I have been trying to conceive for the past six months. Please help.", "output": "Hi. Have serum beta hCG, blood pregnancy test immediately to know pregnancy status. If the pregnancy test comes positive then congratulations. If comes negative then it could be due to some hormonal imbalance, illness, sudden weight gain or weight loss, strict diet, strenuous exercise, illness, contraceptive, etc. You can have hormonal induction by having tablet Primolute N 10 mg twice daily for five days and can have a withdrawal bleed, better to have a blood test on day two of periods, serum progesterone, serum testosterone, serum prolactin, insulin, FSH and LH, thyroid function test, etc.. Fertility issue should be treated in detail after proper unprotected sex for 1 to 2 years and then also if you fail to conceive. Have a healthy lifestyle, physical health, precautions, and try with positivity. Have folic acid daily 0.4 mg if you are not having any chronic health issue. Otherwise, you can have 5 mg daily. Do exercise and walk daily to have normal BMI and weight. Have a healthy, nutritious diet with less salt, sugar, spice,and oil. Have sex in the fertile period of the cycle. In case of irregular cycles, you can regulate cycle by having oral contraceptive pills for three cycles but know that these are contraceptive pills. You can not try in these three months if you are planning to take. It is to support your reproductive system to prepare for pregnancy and soon to have conception. One transvaginal scan as well is needed with blood hormonal tests. Quit recreational drug you and your partner are taking as these reduce fertility and increase chances of congenital anomalies."}

I wish I had a picture of my X-rays from today to make this more clear. But my main concerns are just does this have anything to do with root resorption and are my retainers making my short roots worse? I have not had braces since I was 14 and I have always worn my retainers since. I cannot sleep without them. But are my retainers causing my short roots more stress? And can this lead to root resorption?", "output": "I understand how you feel. But, root resorption occurs in deciduous teeth prior to shedding. In permanent teeth, root resorption occurs during pathologydisease. Regarding the cavities, if it is not near to pulp blood vessel of the tooth, you can get it filled. There is nothing to worry about short roots. If the cavity is near the pulp, you will have to go for a root canal and again short roots will not create a problem with that but the crown placement might be affected. Yes, orthodontic treatment causes mild tooth resorption for tooth movement but is compensated and retainers will not cause much of root resorption. You may genetically or developmentally have short roots. Nothing to worry much, if there is no pathology, problem or mobility. I would suggest you remove the retainers at night as the tissues need some rest eight hours. I hope I have answered your doubt.

When you are pregnant you will have an ultrasound. With the ultrasound, the specialist will measure the cerebral ventricles of the baby. On the off chance that the ventricles are 10 millimeters or more noteworthy in size, then you will be informed that your baby has ventriculomegaly.The result of ventriculomegaly relies on upon a few components including the size of the ventricles, regardless of whether there are some other discoveries on the ultrasound, for example, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and the aftereffects of the amniocentesis. All in all, the result is more awful when the ventricles are bigger, the amniocentesis is unusual, or there are different issues seen on the ultrasound. The best result is regularly watched when 1. the babys ventricles are just somewhat developed measure between 1015 millimeters in size, 2. when there are no different issues seen on the ultrasound, and 3. the hereditary testing results are ordinary this is called mild lateral dilatation.best wishes"}

In some cases, COVIDpositive patients can become false negative in RTPCR reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction result. For those patients, HRCT of the chest is the gold standard test. Again, pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis, and some other diseases can present with such types of clinical features. Do you need a medical fitness certificate for joining your work again? If yes, you should consult your doctor, who has advised you to do an RTPCR test for COVID19. Without examining you physically and watching the investigation reports, it is difficult for any physician to declare you physically fit to return to work.

{"context": "Is laser hair removal safe for someone with acne?", "input": "I am a 21-year-old man. I would like to ask your opinion about laser hair removal. I have read a lot in the last few days and almost everywhere it is said that it is not bad for your health and body and one of the best ways to deal with hair. I am thinking about doing laser removal of hairs in private parts and under the shoulders. I had a problem with acne when I was a teen on my face and back (not normal acne but a big one).Now I am almost healed but some years ago when I tried wax hair removal under the shoulders and on the chest, I started having acne there also. So now I am a little scared to try it. What is your opinion and is it actually harmless?", "output": "The laser is a safe, painless, and permanent method to get rid ofunwanted hairs. It is called laser hair reduction to be more precise. Let me explain to you how this laser works. When the laser is passed through the skin, it targets melanocytes pigmentproducing cells in the hair follicles. It reduces the growth of hair follicles gradually but targets only pigmented hairs. If the hair has turned grey, the laser will not work. You will require at least four sittings to get rid of your unwanted hair. Since you are thinking of your shoulders and private part hair, you will have better results. Because these hairs are controlled by hormones to the least. Whereas facial hairs in a female are very stubborn to the laser. They may take eight sittings as they have a huge hormonal influence. I mentioned laser hair reduction instead of removal because laser not only removes the hair, but also it makes the hair thin and lightly pigmented eventually. So that it is not seen at all like fine hairs over the babys face. Waxing takes out the hair from the root each time, irritating follicles that aggravate acne, but the laser does not have any effect on acne. There are two types of lasers available for hair reduction, one is diode laser  painless and very effective. The second one is the IPL laser, which has very minimal pain, equally effective. I personally prefer diode lasers after using both for my patients. The laser hair reduction process is not harmful to the body because it is a targeted treatment and it does not harm other cells of your body. The laser may seem a little costly but if you compare the benefits of lasers versus waxingshaving, I feel this procedure is worth the money you are paying because it is permanent hair reduction."}

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?", "output": "As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIUmL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses."}

Plz help me", "output": "fewer than one in 10,000 women will get pregnant after tubal ligation in their lifetime. the most common sign of pregnancy is missing your menstrual period. if you got your period on time, and it was normal for you, there is no reason to suspect that you are pregnant. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms that we commonly associate with pregnancy like bloating, breast tenderness, spotting, mood changes, and nausea can be caused by hormonal fluctuations as well as pregnancy. however, in women who do get pregnant after having a tubal ligation, there is a high risk of the pregnancy actually occurring within the fallopian tube, called an ectopic pregnancy. if you do find out that you are pregnant after tubal ligation, it is important to seek medical care right away, as an ectopic pregnancy can be an emergency requiring surgery for treatment. having severe abdominal pain is not normal even if you are not pregnant. for example, appendicitis can cause severe abdominal pain and nausea and kidney infections can also cause abdominal and back pain. any woman can have spotting when the body is under stress from other illnesses. i do recommend that in your situation that you should seek medical care urgently for an evaluation. even though it is unlikely, performing a pregnancy test may be a good idea because if you are pregnant, you should be seen in an emergency room to make sure that your symptoms are not caused by an ectopic pregnancy. it may be prudent for you to go to an emergency room anyway, as other severe illnesses that require hospitalization, such as appendicitis and kidney infections can also be causing symptoms such as yours. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i hope you seek medical care promptly and get an accurate diagnosis of your symptoms. best wishes,"}

We have taken her to doctors, and they put her on antibiotics which do not work, or at least not long enough. She drinks plenty of water every day and does physical activity daily. We are stuck with no treatment plans and do not know what to do. She lives with UTIs, and she is used to it. She claims that every time she goes to the bathroom, it burns really bad and stops her from going to the bathroom more often. She had an ultrasound to prove that she has a bladder infection and to make sure nothing is getting backed up when she goes to the bathroom.", "output": "From the history you gave, it seems that she has a genetic susceptibility to urinary infections. Other reasons could be neurogenic bladder dysfunction, undiagnosed reflux disease, ureterocele and other anatomic causes. Use of daily low dose antibiotic prophylaxis is a good option, but it seems not enough in your daughters case. First, we need to know the infecting organism by doing urine culture and sensitivity. This needs to be treated or controlled with culture sensitive antibiotics. Then, the reasons for repeated infections needs to be identified and resolved. For this I would suggest investigations which are, ultrasonogram of abdomen and pelvis, voiding cystourethrogram, and urodynamic examination. Based on the reports further treatment may be planned. Consulting a urologist or a pediatric urologist will be the best to guide you on further management."}

I am not sure if they are related. I was told the shoulder was spastic muscles but muscle relaxers and naproxen didn't really help. All that helped was time heat and massage but really I still get pains there as well. I am not sure if it nothing, appendix, gall bladder or something else. Can anyone help me", "output": "Hi  The pain in your lower abdomen on the right side could have been due to appendicitis, or due to a ureter calculi giving rise to recurrent pain. This can be diagnosed only by clinical examination followed by some investigations. The pain in your left shoulder seems to be an independent entity, and management should be warm compresses along with anti inflammatory drugs, and physiotherapy. If the pain in your abdomen continues, then I would suggest you to go to your family physician who after clinical examination, may advise you for some basic blood and urine tests, along with an ultrasound abdomen for further management . Wishing you an early recovery."}
{"context": "", "input": "Hi doctor. I am Amardeep Dhamija from India. I have been having my son (age: 18yrs) treated for persistent back ache for 1 year and 4 months now. The problem was diagnosed as arising from low Vitamin D levels ( 2.80) and Vitamin B12 (below 83) levels on 02Dec 2011. He was given ARACHITOL shots and also put on D-gain. I showed him subsequently to an endocrinologist who had a liver test done (SGOT: 14) and (SGPT:14) , Serum Bilirubin (1.37) and Conjugated Bilirubin (0.52) on 18 Dec 2011. Thereafter, I took him to a very senior orthopaedic surgeon who put him on Calcium and Vitamin B12 supplements . Ever since, he has been taking them. His latest tests done on 21 Feb 2013 show Vitamin D 46.40, B12:699 , Calcium 10.00, SGOT: 34 and SGPT:69. Related to this or not, my son also was suffering from Nausea, vomitting etc for which he was prescribed antacids by an endocrinologist. These symptoms have alleviated somewhat. Query: Sorry for the lengthy background but is SGPT level of 69 something to worrry about. I should also like to mention that he is in the final year of school and preparing for exams and is under considerable stress as are other kids like him. Lifestyle: sedantary for about 2 years. Please advise regarding his liver condition and generally what he should do. His back ache is considerably reduced and is only intermittent (normaly when he sits for prolonged hours). Thanks.", "output": "the other apparent cause in your son could be prolonged use of painkillers which he might have taken for his persistent backache. other reasons could be obesity, high triglyceride levels in blood or even diabetes. i advise you to get his lipid profile done. since there is no particular for its cure, i advise following things regular exercisesstop taking any pain killerstake fresh fruits and green vegetablesavoid junk foods like pizzas, burgers,noodles etc. and colas. reduce weight and be in required range of bmi. get his sgpt repeated after 3 months and if you still find it high, then consult a gastroenterologist and get tested for hepatitis markers and other relevant tests."}
{"context": "What causes persistent severe pain in abdomen?", "input": "hello ive had a cold for 3 weeks now. although the sore throat and dripping noste has stopped i still have a very tickly cough. Today as im coughing i feel a slight pulling feeling down near my going but almost near my lower abdominal....i have seen my gp and she said sometimes these colds just take ahwile to life...is this right?", "output": "Hi.You have a specific problem. You have a pain that has developed after cough of 3 weeks duration. The pain after such an attack in the groin, feeling like pulling down can be due to development of a hernia or enlargement of the preexisting hernia. I would advise you to get the abdomen examined by a General Surgeon to rule out or confirm the diagnosis and get operated if this is a hernia after the coughing has completely settled. In the meantime continue the medicines for your respiratory problems, take steam inhalations, multivitamins, get investigated for routine so that a fitness is achieved for anesthesia and surgery."}

Once i quit, i started to use e-cigs for 1 year and eventually stopped smoking e-cigs and have been on nicotine gum ever since. I am 30, not in bad shape, i am muscular. No one would describe me as fat. I was scared I was going to have a heart attack and the doctor checked my heart but said there was nothing wrong with it. He did an ultrasound and made me ride a bike. Could it be nicotine causing my palpitations and shortness of breath? My dad has cardiomyopathy and recently had to have surgery. When i went to the doctor he said i did not have it. So i have narrowed it down to nicotine. It s scary to be honest. It should be noted that i was diagnosed with sleep apnea at 22. I snore alot while sleeping and always have. Sometimes, even while awake, i notice that i have been holding my breath. They said in the sleep study that I stop breathing and now i notice that i even stop breathing while awake without realizing it.", "output": "I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

They've been there since yesterday morning, and are slightly raised today.  She complains that they itch. I know they're not mosquito bites...any ideas??", "output": "HiWelcome to the HCMIn my opinion it might be a mosquito or a bed bug bite.A mosquito bite is a very itchy round, red, or pink skin bump does not hurt. It doesnt hurt when the bed bug bites, but many people develop an allergic reaction to the saliva of the bug usually between 24 hours and three days later, resulting in a raised, red skin bump or welt that is intensely itchy and inflamed. Both the welt and the itchiness may last for several days. Bed bug bites can occur anywhere on the body, but are typically on uncovered areas, such as the neck, face, arms, and hands  and are often found in a row of two or more."}

{"context": "", "input": "I dont know, anxiety , pressure , thyroids, hypoglucemy, please help me im desperate My problem is quite long so please read it all, im desperate for an answer. Ok, it all started once when i was taking a shower, i almost faint because of the steam. This happened in november, and i could be fine in school until december, although i had some weird feelings which were related to the fear. Well, this fear wasnt that big, but when i finished school (december, i live in south america) i started to think: Anything can happen anytime, i better take care of my body and i started to overprotect it, like a hypocondriac, i felt some days i couldnt breath , one night, i really couldnt breath, i couldnt move, i was sweating, i was shaking, but yet, i dont know why i didnt ask for help. Ok so i managed to fell asleep and when i woke up i didnt have any of the sypmtoms just a little bit of nerviosism. After this i felt good for 1 week, when it started again, the feeling that i couldnt breath, so i told my mom and she took me to a doctor, he examinated me and said my heart and lungs were ok, very well, i was so happy it wasnt something physical but i told my dad, and instead of saying Thats great son!, he just told me But i dont think its that, i think its because you spend too much time on the computer This saddened me. Ok, i kept with my live until one day, my feelings returned, but this time it was in the morning, couldnt breath, sweating, etc. And my parents were crying because they said Oh how can we help him, we do not have money That worried me and the symptoms got much worse, we had to go to urgency, the medic who first examinated me, told me my problem was in my mind, and just to be sure, i got torax x-rays and an ECG because i had some discomfort in the left armpit. Both exams were ok, and i went home. Since then i felt better, but other symptoms appared, this time, weird feelings when i stood from a chair, like a pressure going up from my chest , it dissapeared in 3 seconds but it was discomfortable, i also had some discomfort at the sides of the forehead, i couldnt stand up sometimes. The worst of all is that my parents didnt believe me, they thought i was creating all this because i wanted, AND I WAS ON VACATION, why would i do that? But they kept not believing me, i didnt know how to act, if i showed a sign of my discomfort my parents would ground me. Some time happened and those symptoms dissapeared: the feelings on the sides of the forehead and the pressure going up. Some days later, i started to get like a vacuum on my heart zone, it was not pain, it didnt irradiate. I had some in my lyfe, like 1 per 2 years, and i didnt really care about it, but now i had 6 per DAY, and obviously, my parents were mad at me, but one night, i was shaking and sweating again, i could breath, but those heart sensations came every 15 minutes, and my mom was yelling at me that she didnt want me anymore to be her son, that because of me she had all her problems, and i didnt cry because i was worried about my heart, after 2 hours, my mom told me she would take me to the doctor. At the next day the doctor told me my problem could be intestinal, so i had a panendoscopy, which said i had gastritis , duodenitis, and the helycobacter pyrali, i started an antibiotic treatment, and the bacter dissapeared, all good there, but now i have other symptoms BUT, i assume my problem is my mind, i know im overprotecting my body with every thing i feel, i recognize it and im with a psychologist , im getting over it, but yet, i have some feelings and i attribute them to diseases. I have panic attacks and anxiety crisis, and im taking clonazepam for it. So please, to stay calm, can you answer this please? -Whenever i try to stand, it takes me a while, because i feel like enough blood was not getting to my eye inmediatly, maybe it not that, but i feel weird everytime i stand up, when im waking up i need to sit for 30 seconds before standing up. -Weird feelings in my hands, when im really nervous, and sometimes i get them too when im not nervous but not as big. When i press and rub my arms, i get this tingling in my hands -I know the bacter is over but sometimes i still feel discomfort in the area above the heart, like on my shoulder , my medic told me they were gases but i dont believe it that much, i know its not the heart, but it scares me -I ve had palpations for a long time, when i feel palpations i dont feel my heart pumping faster, i just feel it, mostly when i stop breathing when i want to really focus on something, thats when i feel it. - Most of the times after i wake up, i touch my chest zone and i feel my heart pumping fast, i dont hear or feel the palpations, just when i touch my chest, i feel my heart is pumping fast, with some breathing exercises i calm it down, but it scares me, if i didnt touch my chest, i wouldnt know my heart is pumping faster, its weird. -Recently ive been getting some discomfort in my back neck, its not pain, could this be stress? P.S I ve been recently diagnosed with astigmatism .

What could be all possible causes? Nobody around me feels that smell and that is how I got to know that it is from my nose itself. Please advice.", "output": "Bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. Let us see those one by one. Malignancy an intranasal inside the nose or intraoral inside the mouth malignancy can produce foul smell, that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. Malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. Malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. Dental infection a tooth decay can produce bad smell. Dental infection usually produces significant pain. Food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. Sinusitis Chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge pus discharge. This results in foul odor. Maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. Sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache, facial pain, nasal blockage, post nasal drip, etc. Foreign body inside nose A foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. The discharge will be from one side of the nose. It is common among kids. Foreign body produces nasal block. Atrophic rhinitis It is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. Also the condition causes merciless anosmia loss of sensation of smell. The sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. Atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. Maggots in nose Maggots are larval stage of fly chrysomia. Maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. Fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. They are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. Tonsillitis Pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. Tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. Other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever, throat pain, enlarged lymph nodes of neck, difficulty and pain while swallowing. Nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. Diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. Rhinitis caseosa it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. It was thought to be a fungal disease, exact etiology is still not clear. Tuberculosis TB of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis, consequent death of tissues and foul smell. Hope I have cleared your query. Further evaluation and clinical examination is required."}

If it was started at an early stage, new hair regrowth may be expected.Response varies from individual to individual and is usually evident after 46 months of regular use.Regards"}

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesnt require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 47 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given that too only if fever is more than 100 F.

After VCUG, we realized that she has VUR grade 2 in both kidneys. The DMSA scan interpretation was that low-lying small-sized right kidney with a cortical defect in the inferior half. Mild reduced cortical function in the inferior pole of the left kidney with prominent PSC. The renal function of the right kidney is 30 %, and the left kidney is 70 %. What can we do now?", "output": "Sorry to hear about your daughter. As you rightly infer, she has vesicoureteric reflux. Right is more affected than left. This severity of affection is usually not expected, though, from grade II reflux. Hence, there is a possibility of independent kidney affection for her, apart from VUR, by birth. However, that does not affect our management. It is just an observation. As per current guidelines, her management involves Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary infection till the age of 6 years. Monthly urine routine and urine culture if needed. Antibiotics, if we find infection in urine, even if she is asymptotic. Testing for urine protein, which can give an idea of the severity of the disease. Yearly DMSA dimercapto succinic acid and considering surgical correction if new scar develops or reflux grade increase which is unlikely. Complete her vaccinations and good nutrition.

What could be the reason for my late periods?", "output": "As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIUmL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses."}
{"context": "How can one get HIV or STD?", "input": "I am worried about a case that happened just a few days ago. I had asked for a massage service. She washed my body and did a soft hand job for me using lotion and soap. Then, later on, during the massage, I was wearing my underwear, and she was fully naked. I have actually sucked her chest and nipple heavily, but I did not notice if she actually had breastfeeding milk. I asked her about her actual job as she is a sex worker and has seen two customers before me on the same day. Also, I had noticed that she had like healed skin rash on her right shoulder; when I asked, she said it was not an allergy, but has had this since she was born. Can you please advise if such experience may transmit HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)? Does a hand job considered a risk or safe sex practice? Can I get infected with STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) through hand job? It lasted for less than 2 to 3 minutes, and I asked her to stop. Apparently, she is not married, and not sure if she is actually lactating, and I did not taste anything. Is it possible that nipple or licking her chest may transmit any STD? In particular, HIV? I have a regular partner that I have been trying to avoid for a week since this happened, and not sure if I can get my regular sex life again. Is it safe to resume my regular sex life with my partner? Does HIV or STI usually transmit through a micro crack or damaged skin? I started to feel headaches and night sweating 20 days after this incident, and I feel my lymph node has swelling and not feeling well. I am very concerned, and I wish this never happened. I cannot get it over.", "output": "Let me answer your queries one by one. If there is any breast milk secretion then you are at risk. No, hand job does not put you on risk of a sexually transmitted disease STD. There are a lot of STDs which can be transmitted through hand jobs. For example, wart, molluscum contagiosum. If there is no secretion then you are not at risk. I would suggest you to refrain from resuming sex life with your partner till your tests are negative. Yes, HIV or STI can be transmitted from any secretion through cracks. You need to get testing at 4 weeks and 12 weeks in order to be confirmed about your negative status. I hope it helps."}

Most of us have social anxiety to varying extents  some have less anxiety than you do, while some have more. So, when does it become an illness? For symptoms such as these which fall on a continuum, abnormalityillness is determined on the basis of how much trouble the symptoms are causing you. If your symptoms are significantly impacting your functioning in an important domain e.g. social, interpersonal, work etc, then it can be considered a disorder and be treated. From your description, you most likely do not have Social Anxiety Disorder your symptoms represent a slightly more extreme variation of normal. In any case, even if it is not a disorder, an improvement in these features would be of benefit to you. Psychotherapy is the best solution in this case. You will certainly benefit from Cognitive Behaviour Therapy or Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. However, psychotherapy requires hard work and commitment you have to decide if an improvement in these symptoms would be worth putting in all the hard work. Finally, let me reiterate  some amount of social anxiety is very common, so you are not alone. The fact that the anxiety has gotten better with age is reassuring.

I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear.  I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.", "output": "Stress thallium is the best test to be done in you. I guess you did not have any symptoms like chest pain or heaviness during stress test and if so it will still suggest the absence of significant heart disease. In my opinion, there is not much difference between exercise echo and chemical stress echo and not invalid, but nuclear scans like stress thallium is certainly a better test. I would advise for a nuclear scan as it would be more informative. Anyhow, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week. Avoid meat, smoking, and alcohol if any. There should not be any abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

What to do?", "input": "I am having problems with acid reflux, digestion, occasionally mild pain in the throat, feeling like vomiting, and depression.

Thank you in advance.", "output": "As far as Betamethasone dipropionate and Zinc sulphate lotion is concerned, it is mainly given for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and hair fall due to it. It has no effect on androgenetic hair loss. Since, you had dandruff this lotion would have helped to reduce hair fall because of it. Minoxidil is approved for androgenetic alopecia. It should be used in 5 concentration. During the initial part of therapy with Minoxidil, patients might interpret increased hair shedding. But it is temporary and it is due to new hair growth that pushes telogen hair shedding of hair during the resting phase of hair follicle out of hair follicle. In addition to Minoxidil I would also suggest you to take a tablet of Finasteride 1 mg once daily."}

{"context": "How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine?", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

There is considerable variation in the incidence and severity of sequelae in patients surviving viral encephalitis. The incidence and severity of sequelae were directly related to the age of the patient and the level of consciousness at the time of initiation of therapy. Patients with severe neurologic impairment Glasgow coma score 6 at initiation of therapy either died or survived with severe sequelae. Young patients of less than 30 years with good neurologic function at initiation of therapy did substantially better 100 survival, 62 with no or mild sequelae when compared with their older counterparts 30 years 64 survival, 57 no or mild sequelae.

Together, these can cause varices of the rectum and anal canal which may bleed on pressure while defecation. Infections of the bowel also can lead to such symptoms. You can see a surgeon for a local careful examination to rule out any external or internal hemorrhoids and fissures. Adequate bed rest, diet regulations to make the stool softer and avoiding constipation are the mainstay of management at this stage. Local applications can be used to heal. Hope this helps."}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

{"context": "I am perimenopausal and I have not got my periods. Am I pregnant?", "input": "Hello doctor, I am a 46-year-old female and my periods have become increasingly irregular. They used to be around 24 days in length and my current cycle is now 36 days. My basal body temperature indicated that I may have ovulated on day 10. But I have not menstruated at all this cycle - not even spotting. Late last week, I had slight cramps and pains in the regions near my ovaries, which made me think that perhaps my body was trying to ovulate again. I have taken a pregnancy test, which was negative. I do not believe I am pregnant; rather, I think I may be entering into perimenopause. I have been trained for a marathon last year and during training, I ran up to 50 km or more per week. I had a cycle of 36 days. However, since that time, my cycles have been as short as 14 days but no longer than 31 days. My partner and I use condoms and I track my cycle so that we do not need to use these on infertile days. However, given the length of this cycle, I am unsure whether condoms are necessary until after I have menstruated next. My question relates to fertility in this perimenopausal stage. As I believe I ovulated on day 10, does this mean I remain infertile until I get my next period? Or is my body going to ovulate again, meaning that I will again be fertile?", "output": "No, you have not ovulated on day 10 because if it would have been so you would have had your period by now. Menstruation usually occurs 14 days after ovulation and the duration between ovulation and menstruation is always fixed. Ovulation occurs only once in one cycle. I suggest you repeat the pregnancy test after one week. Since your cycles are irregular now, you cannot rely on fertile period method. Take proper contraception during an entire cycle. If you do not get your period even after a week and pregnancy test comes out to be negative again then you should undergo some investigations to find out the cause. I suggest you get a thyroid profile, prolactin levels, serum LH luteinizing hormone and serum FSH folliclestimulating hormone checked."}

Went to the emergency room my bp at the time was 153 over 104. They were more concerned by my blood pressure which I am sure was elevated because of the severe pain I was experienceing. I told them I thought the pain was coming from my ovaries or uterus. They checked my appendix and told me they couldn t find anything wrong with me, but got my blood pressure down after giving me pain medicine. They gave me a prescription for pain medicine and sent me on my way. I have since had pain almost every month most of the time not as severe, but several times it has been. I still spot once a month and sometimes when the pain is severe I bleed like a normal period. I have had a colonoscopy and everything was fine.

Uterine Ablation is due for menorrhagia, which must have been suffering. Yes the blood pressure usually rises with pain. Raised blood pressure does not cause pain in abdomen. Now you have pain in abdomen on and off, spotting once a month, and you bleed when the pain is severe. This indicates that you are still suffering from menorrhagia and hormonal imbalance. If you have completed the family meaning have kids, it is wise to undergo Hysterectomy. his will solve the problem permanently.

I was able to see a Doctor a little more than a month later. The main spot had grown in size and had been draining puss and other fluid as well as blood. The doctor had taken a culture to test for MRSA. He had drained it and reported it looked like cottage cheese comming out. I was placed on a anti-biotic called Sulfa-meth tri-meth, for ten days. The MRSA test came back as negative and I was told that It came backs as coagulis negative staphaloccus. In march of 2010 I had 2 drains placed in the back of my head for proximetly 24 hours. It was then deemed I should need surgery to remove any mass that had been built up under the skin. By this time the spot was huge draining everyday but never getting smaller. I had surgery and underwent a general anesthesia. I was placed in an infirmary for 7 weeks where they were to do a wet to dry healing for the surgery. The wound never officially healed it is now October and coming upon one year from when the problem first started.

You have fear about getting Herpes simplex. Your parents are not able to notice any bump but still you have strong belief that there is something wrong. You have to check lips and oral cavity again and again. Some times you have fear of cranker sores. As most of the times you have fear of herpes while no one noticed anything serious, so most likely the symptoms are due to health anxiety or hypochondriasis. In patients of hypochondriasis serious anxiety occurs because of fear of illness. Some times delusional ideas occur for some illness.Consult a psychiatrist for evaluation and management. In most cases antidepressants prove useful. Commonly SSRIs like fluoxetine or Paroxetine are used.

Stress alopecia is also common in which females keep their hair very tight in a certain manner, creating tension in the root and causing hair fall. Straightening and other procedures also cause weakness of roots. Other conditions like fever, typhoid, malaria, thyroid, etc., can also cause hair fall, but these are less common. Regarding treatment, have a good sleep. Eat proper food with green vegetables and fruits. Take multivitamins like Follihair Biotin, Copper, Iron, Selenium, Zinc. LCysteine. LLysine, and Methionine or Xtraglo for at least three months. Check your blood hemoglobin. You should start an iron and folic acid supplement if it is less.

Elevate your foot above the level of your heart to help reduce swelling. When lying down, prop your foot on a couple of pillows. Resting your feet is important when your toes swell.3. Tape a broken toe to the toe next to it. This method, referred to as buddy taping, will help stabilize and support the healing toe. Place gauze between the toes before taping them to prevent friction and irritation on the skin.4. Wear shoes that fit properly. Wearing tight shoes may cause swelling in the toes. Illfitting shoes can also cause neuromas  benign growths of nerves located between two toes  to occur because of tissue rubbing together.5. Massage your toes to help increase blood supply to the feet and toes, which may help reduce the swelling."}

Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and other fluids to help ease constipation and flush out toxins, eat a healthy diet with plenty of fiber, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein to help regulate your digestive system, avoid certain foods like fatty or spicy foods, which can exacerbate symptoms of indigestion, so try to limit or avoid these foods if they seem to worsen your symptoms, and get plenty of rest because stress and lack of sleep can worsen abdominal pain, so make sure to manage stress through activities like exercise, yoga, or meditation.

{"context": "Can caffeine cause heart palpitations?", "input": "Hello doctor, How is it possible that I got heart palpitations from caffeine use (5.8 mg/kg a day)? Could it be that I also used Wellbutrin?", "output": "Yes, both these caffeine and Wellbutrin commonly causes palpitations. Even a lower dose of caffeine can cause palpitations and there is no as such dose relationship with respect to palpitations. It may lead to all your symptoms. Also, anxiety or stress is usually an additional factor which may cause or worsen the palpitations. Usually, palpitations like these are usually benign and nonlifethreatening although they may be troublesome. Considering your comorbidities, it is better to evaluate these, not just due to palpitations but also as screening cardiac test, and to rule out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, you should have a baseline ECG especially during palpitations and may need 24 hours Holter monitoring if not able to get ECG during palpitations. Also, you may alternatively use mobilebased rhythm monitors like Alivecor Kardia or other monitors. Also, you should get one echo done to look for the status of heart and its valve. So, try to reduce caffeine consumption as much as possible and see the response."}

Swelling and burning sensation in the hard palate is due to prolonged use of alcohol , this will subside with time dont worry. discontinue the use of alcohol , apply oral antiseptics like dentogel topically over the affected area. i hope this helps , take care."}

So i took a pregnancy test but it came out negative, should i have waited to take it or is it right? i m just so confused because when i looked it all up it says pregnancy but the test came out negative.", "output": "pinkish color on the toilet paper can be caused by intestine imagination intussusception. it causes strong abdominal which can suddenly disappear if the intestine comes back to regular state. sometimes it is very hard to diagnose it. abdominal ultrasound during the pain should visualize it. viral intestinal infection is also possible especially if your pain wont happen again. however, if your symptoms will come back again, diagnostics should be done including abdominal ultrasound, colonoscopy, full blood work. hope this will help."}

It feels like it has fever and is very painful.I went to ER and they said they coucouldn t find anything. Please help me Im in tears.", "output": "Dear user,Firstly to control your pain, while you get further investigations. There are a couple of things that will help1. Regular pain killers. Start with regular over the counter Paracetamol  if you are not allergic or have liver problems. You can add on stronger pain kilkers like Diclofenacmake sure you get a prescription for some PPI e.g Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole to rotect your stomach with this, Tramadol, Oxycodonewith tjis you might need a laxative for the first few days. 2. Pressure Stocking. You can start with class 2 elastic stockings above knee. Your pharmacist should be able to help with sizing.3. Avoid prolonged standing3. Elevate your leg when your sitting or lying to help rdduce the swelling.This swelling could be because of Varicose veins, Cellulitis due some infection around your foot or leg, DVT deep vein thrombosis this is one of more serious problems where a deep system of veins is blocked and blood keeps pooling in the legs.While you are dealing with pain, try and get an appointment with a Vascular Surgeon, if not get your doctor to examine and refer you to them. They will be able to look at the veins in your leg and the ball of vessels behind your knee. They might need to do some scans though. In the meantime, stockings and elevation should help with discomfort anyways.Thanks"}

{"context": "I am 26 years old, female who has PTSD, bipolar and major depression. I also suffer from migraines, anxiety, and insomnia.", "input": "Hello doctor, I am 26 years old, female who has PTSD, bipolar and major depression. I also suffer from migraines, anxiety and insomnia. I am on topamax 100 mg twice a day, clonapin 0.5 thrice a day as needed, Paxil 10 mg in the morning (recently started) also for the insomnia I was started on elavil 25 mg on friday but I have not taken it yet because I noticed one of the side effects could cause QT prolongation which I do not know, but I am wondering if it is the same or very similar to the side effect of seroquel (arrthythmia as a side effect). I used to take seroquel for bipolar and insomnia, it worked well for about 6 months but then I started having instances every night where I went extremely tachycardic, could not breathe, turned blue and had to be rushed to the hospital. They were calling it a panic attack for several days before they figured out if it was the seroquel and my EKG was abnormal and it was too dangerous for me to be on and I could have died. Anyhow, I do not respond to any of the sleeping pills (the benzo ones) nor the highly sedating ones like the antipsychotics or even trazadone or benadryl or vistoryl or such. I am working on getting a sleep study, so this is my last option till then. Also, I cannot see my doctor until Thursday, and I feel like part of my insomnia is because my body has become dependent on the clonapin. I am trying not to take it at all, but my chest is starting to hurt, I am getting more anxiety and more headaches. How can I start to taper down before Thursday? What is the best way? I need to get better sleep. I am starting to really suffer. It has been 3 weeks of about 10 hours\u00a0of sleep\u00a0each week. Also, could Paxil give me more headaches? Sorry about all the questions. I notice I have more headaches now and the topamax was recently increased to 200/day. I feel so angry, I just need a break. Please help me with some answers if you could.", "output": "Hi. I read your concerns. I feel that Topamax 200mg which works well for migraine has a little role in bipolar disorders. Studies show that monotherapy with topamax is not recommended but instead of taking topamax, you can try sodium valproate Depakote xr 750mg at night which will be helpful to you in both your migraine and bipolarity. Divalpoex sodium depakote has sedative property as a side effect. So it will be helpful to you in your insomnia. If you take 750 mg of Dep. at night then you can reduce the night dosage of clonapin and gradually increase the dosage of depakote to 1000 mg and reduce the clonapin. You can also take 500mg in morning and 1000mg at night. And I feel that if you are feeling depressed then only you should take paxil, otherwise there is no role of it in bipolar disorder. If your migraine is severe then you should take propranolol 10mg twice a day. But you have to take care about your heart, because you complained about side effects of seroquel. Propranolol is beta blocker, It is used in prophylaxis for migraine. And I feel that if you use it you finally will get relief from your migraine. I do not know whether you have ever tried non benzos like zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone. You should try that also for your sleep. I feel that, these will satisfy some of your concerns. You can book for an online therapy at icliniq for further consultation with me either via video session or on phone."}
{"context": "Can telogen effluvium cause hair thinning, brittle hair, and changes in hair color and texture in a 25-year-old male?", "input": "I am a 25-year-old male, and I first noticed my hair going through rapid changes in the past five years. The color and texture of my hair changed rapidly from dark brown to golden blonde (mainly on the front part of the scalp). As a result, my hair turned brittle and dry and began to thin out in the front part of the scalp. However, I notice hair growths, but they occur slowly in one area. I do not take any medications, and this condition worsened after the start of the pandemic. I have never experienced excessive hair loss or hair fall in the past. So, I believe this results from long-term periods of stress and wanted to confirm that it may be a case of telogen effluvium. Please give your suggestions.", "output": "Hair thinning and lightening can be multifactorial. One of the factors, as you rightly mentioned, is stress. Apart from that, there are multiple factors, including dietary changes, hormonal imbalances, underlying medication conditions, vitamin deficiencies, climate changes, and a history of infection or surgery. Telogen effluvium occurs as a result of these factors. Since you have had longterm stressful events, it may be telogen effluvium. It appears with thinning of hair after a stressful event, and it may be acute or chronic, where it can be constant for years. Fortunately, most hair loss or thinning that occur due to the same are reversible and usually do not require any treatment. However, you may need to undergo a few blood tests to rule out the underlying conditions and deficiencies. So kindly get tested for CBC complete blood count, Hb hemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum iron, serum zinc, serum copper, vitamin D3, vitamin B12, TFT thyroid function test, and DHEAS dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. If there are any changes in these parameters, the appropriate medication will be advised for promoting hair growth, increasing hair density, and reversing the color and texture of hair. The other treatment modalities include PRP Plateletrich plasma or mesotherapy, in which plateletrich plasma is extracted from 10 to 12 ml of your blood, and vitamin solution is injected into your scalp at areas of hair thinning. The platelets in the PRP and vitamins in mesotherapy act as growth factors for stimulating your hair follicles to grow and become dense. When combined, both procedures are executed at an interval of 15 days for six months. PRF Plateletrich fibrin, biotin PRP and laser treatment are other procedures that promote hair growth by stimulating hair follicles. For these procedures, inperson consultation with a dermatologist is advised. In addition, if not treated, telogen effluvium may become chronic, causing poor hair growth compared to acute telogen effluvium therefore, these procedures are advised in that case. There are topical solutions like a combination of Minoxidil antihypertensive vasodilator and Finasteride 5alpha reductase inhibitors 5  solution, which may be applied in 1 ml quantity at night daily on the area of scalp visibility to promote hair growth, this increases blood flow to the hair roots. However, it is advised to be used for several years and should only be tapered. For example, the solution should be applied once daily for one year, then once daily for six days per week for the second year, once daily for five days per week for the next year, and so on. Stopping this solution abruptly can cut off the blood flow to the hair roots and cause the newly grown hair to fall. Minoxidil is not advised in case of allergies, migraines, underlying medical conditions, etc. Stress management should also be considered for faster recovery from telogen effluvium. Restoring pigmentation, texture, and growth may be timeconsuming but requires consistency and patience for results to show. Kindly follow up with the reports for further assessment and treatment. I hope this has helped you out. Take care."}

Went to GP and she said that she wasn t concerned about it and I should go back and see her if it became the size of a golfball. It was about the size of a peanut. A couple weeks later went to Urgent care and was tested for Strep throat(negative) because my throat and neck hurt. Was given antibiotics for sinus infection . I was later referred to ENT by the GP for a CT scan of sinus. This only showed a small polyp in left maxifacial which ENT said was not causing blockage but I did have swelling in my nose and was given another round of antibiotics. A few weeks later I felt like something was pushing against my neck and was constantly pulling at my shirts because it felt like they were on my neck. Went back to GP and she sent me for ultrasound of Thyroid. This showed 2 nodules on my right thyroid 9mm and 1cm. the 1cm looks to be cystic. GP also ran TSH and T4 and antibodies test which all came back normal, but thyroid was enlarged. I asked for a CBC and found out my WBC was 15.5. GP gave broad spectrem antibiotic for 2 weeks. Retested a moth later and WBC is now 11 which is still a little high. Saw ENT on Monday he saw no need for fine needle biopsy because the largest nodule is cystic. Ordered a soft tissue CT for enlarged lymph nodes which showed that I have several borderline nodes with the largest being on the right side but none were reactive to the dye. I didn t even know I had a enlarged node on the right side as I can t feel it. I was given the option to moniter them? Or have a biopsy of one of them. I am at a loss as to what to do or where to turn. It seems that every fall I feel sick and have a elevated WBC, but they never know why. In 2010 WBC was 13, 2011 it was 12.2 and this year 15.5.

Cause for concern?", "input": "I am a 38 year old woman and I was in a car accident in 2011, which led to compression burst fractures of T-4 and T-5. I had surgery a year later they put in rods, screws, a cage, and done a spinal fusion from T-2 through T-8. While testing before the surgery they found I also have osteoporosis of the spine, stenosis at multiple levels, degenerative disk disease and kyphosis. Anyway during surgery they found the spine wasn't straight and that it was worse then the MRI and X-rays showed. The Surgeon told my husband and family that he couldn't get the spine completely straight and the hardware could never be removed. I have been having lots of pain in the shoulders, chest, back, neck, hands and arms. At times my hands and arms feel like they are asleep and or I could be holding something in my hand and just drop it like my hand isn't even there. I can get cut doing dishes from a knife or burn my hands and not even feel it! When lifting my arms up or reaching something in my back, well the best way I can put it is, it feels as if something is pulling, snapping, and popping. I have been on Norco 7.5mg for 2 years now at first they were helpful but now they don't help at all. As of three weeks ago the doc decided to take the pain meds and told me to take Ibuprofen and over the counter Tylenol. Which I am having to take 1600mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and 1500mg of Tylenol every 4 hours and that just puts me to sleep it does nothing for the pain. I think the surgeon believes it should all be better and refuses to listen. My back burns,pulls, feels like I am being stabbed from the inside out, and just plain hurts all the time, so I went back to my surgeon whom without any new x-rays or anything, in fact the last tests he done was 3 months after my surgery and they havent even tried sending me to physical Therapy. This same doctor now tells me they need to go in and take the hardware out. I reminded him of his previous statement about the hardware havin to stay in and he replays it will be fine. My questions are is this anywhere normal, what could happen if they remove the hardware? Will i be in worse shape then I already am? Should I even consider doing the surgery to have it removed?

After four months of love life, I got pregnant. Since that day my mother-in-law changed her behavior with me as well as due to family members instruction my husband started giving space to me. He started watching porn clips at the night time. I almost felt like suffocation to spend my whole day in all household work and the rest of my time in temple with my mother-in-law as per her wish.\u00a0One day in frustration he told me that he is neither interested in me nor my baby. His words hurt me a lot. But, still I tried to convince myself. But within a few days, when his mother told me that I have to get up early in the morning at 5 to wash the clothes; I did not cooperate. Then, my husband told me that I have to find the solution and they were unable to cope with me. I felt like no one is thinking about my pregnancy as well as my health. So, I decided to go to my parent\u2019s home and\u00a0left my husband without any information.When I reached my home, I realized that my mother is unwell. Within just two or three days when we visited a doctor we came to know that it was cancer. I was unable to discuss my feelings with her. Meanwhile my husband and mother-in-law tried a lot for my come back. But, I never gave response to them, not even a phone call. After one month, we met a cancer specialist and he told us he could only pray about results as it was third stage. We were in huge tension. My husband came there and told me to come back. However, the next day after a long phone conversation he said either come back or give divorce. This hurt me a lot as I was 5 months pregnant. Then, till my delivery no one from my husband\u2019s family contacted me.\u00a0I gave birth to a baby boy, but due to some complications doctor made it a Cesarean operation. Immediately they shifted my baby to NICU. I was not able to breastfeed him, but sent my milk to him for five days. On the seventh day he got serious as he had suffocation problem and done ECG. Then I informed the issue to my husband, but unfortunately we lost our baby the same day. Since that day he messaged me to come back, but I was not in a state to reply. Nearly after seven months, I met and got to know he too frustrated, weak and thought he is also suffering from emotional turmoil. Since that day I am trying to convince him for reunion, but he is denying.Then we met in court for mutual divorce. As he did not clarify the reason for divorce we were advised to meet counselor. Counselor said we have only communication problem and suffering from baby\u2019s thoughts. Due to my mom\u2019s health, I did not meet him again. Sadly, I lost my mom before six months. Now, I came to know that my mother-in-law too passed away before five months. Now, his father asked me for divorce as he wishes to see his son\u2019s second marriage, but my husband denied this. I want to continue this relationship as I love my husband. He always submits me the same answer that whenever he sees me he remembers all the painful memories and so he is unable to live with me. Recently, he said that he does not wish to have our baby back and do not want any relationship with me. Since that day I am suffering a lot through emotional turmoil.\u00a0I am missing my baby, my mother and my husband. It is very hard for me to handle my mood swing. I never had any quarrel with my in-laws or with husband. Though I am facing this situation and it hurts. Today, I am suffering so much and I had some milk like nipple discharge.

I diagnosed for the reasons and went through tests as guided by a physician (SGPT,SGOT count was reported high) last year(2012) but nothing particular came out and my doctor advised that this might be due to anxiety/depression. I was advised to take Trika Plus 0.5 by one of our family doctor for sometime, which i took for 6 months. Last year i referred to one of renowned psychiatrist in town as i was not getting permanent relief, he then advised me to take Clonotril 0.25 (Clonazepam) , Prothiaden and Rexipra 10mg (Escitalopram). I am on above said 3 drugs for last 1.5 years and during this time my pukish feeling was fine but i turned out too lazy ,sleepy, inactive and also sometimes suicidal thoughts crossed my mind.

As the causes of infection are multifactorial, results favoring both schools of thought are seen. Since you are only undergoing arthroscopy or hernia repair, the duration of surgery, soft tissue handling, the absence of prosthesis all favor very low risk of infection. You can continue turmeric, multivitamin, and fish oil until the day before your surgery. Vitamin D supplements should, however, be taken only after physician consultation and if the serum levels of vitamin D are normal, they should be discontinued. Excess Vitamin D intake can lead to hypervitaminosis D."}

Thyroid nodules are fairly common more so in women and the majority up to 95  are benign. If you do not have major risk factors for thyroid cancer such as past exposure to radiation to the neck area, a past history of thyroid cancer or a first degree relative with thyroid cancer or suspicious looking nodules on ultrasound then the risk of these nodules being cancer is low."}

Many people do respond to a combination of Lamotrigine and Quetiapine popularly called as Lamiquel. It takes time to act, but it is highly effective. Currently, I would suggest that instead of Lithium you use Lamotrigine 25 mg x 2, then 50 mg x 2 and finally 100 mg x 2. Dose titration is every two to three weeks. Instead of Olanzapine, I would replace it with Quetiapine 50 to 100 mg for start and raise if needed based on the sedation. Also, continue Escitalopram if needed or replace it with a TCA tricyclic antidepressant class of antidepressants. And yes, do add Bupropion Wellbutrin.

She is VERY reluctant to seek medical treatment...she even hates taking the occasional motrin.", "output": "i read your question carefully, and . from your description your mother seems to show manifestations of dementia. dementia can have many causes, stroke being one of them, however the most common one and also compatible with your mothers symptoms is alzheimers disease. naturally some other potential causes must be excluded through tests such as brain imaging to exclude stroke or tumor and some blood tests such as blood count, glucose, liver and kidney function tests, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, vitamin b12 levels. if after the tests and medical evaluation the diagnosis will remain alzheimers there are some available treatments to slow down its progression but unfortunately not to halt it altogether, only slow it down. eventually she will need constant attention as she will not be able to function independently. however, as i said that diagnosis must be confirmed first. i hope to have been of help."}
{"context": "How to go about the treatment in a patient with chronic cough?", "input": "My mother underwent gallbladder surgery 10 months ago. For the past three months, she started having a chronic cough. She tried many home remedies. She did not recover completely. I took my mother recently for a health checkup. As I suspected the chest report was not fine. But, the doctor was not at all concerned about her cough and said everything is normal. Why is it so? I want to know what is the meaning of this X-ray report and what should be our next step. Presently she is under medication for thyroid as well as diabetes. I have attached her reports. Kindly have a look at them and suggest how to go about the treatment. .", "output": "Thanks for choosing this platform. As you said your mother is having chronic cough four months after surgery. It can be just a coincidental finding as her Xray  is showing prominent basal vascular markings and the cough can be aggravated by surgery. The Xray findings are suggestive of an interstitial lung disease called lung fibrosis which can be confirmed only after an HRCT highresolution computed tomography scan of the chest. So at the earliest, I advise you to do an HRCT scan of the chest to rule out IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment can be started accordingly. IPF or lung fibrosis is a chronic and progressive condition. So, a diagnosis should be made as early as possible. Talk to your pulmonologist regarding further investigations and treatment. He will guide you better as frequent followup visits are required for monitoring the disease. The treatment plan would be steroids and immunosuppressants. Strict control of BP blood pressure and blood sugar is a must."}

I think i can feel my blood pounding to my brain and i get a head ache on one side, my right side of my head. All this stops after about a minute or so.", "output": "Lyng on the belly means that you are pressing against the abdominal wall. There is the aorta which takes the pressure of your weight pressing against the abdomen. It is a common law of physics that everything pumping against a blockage or resistence, should pump harder, in order to overcome that resistence. This is the same thing that happens in the human body. The heart pumps into the arteries, and the bigger the artery that has the resistence, the harder should heart pump against it, to keep proper supply of oxygen and nutrients distal to the resistence. If this is a worrisome event to you, then I suggest not to assume the lying on the belly position. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"}

Why?", "input": "Hello doctor,  More than two months ago, I started getting this constant feeling of food being stuck in the top back of my left tonsil. I looked in the mirror and did not see anything suspicious in my throat. Since I get tonsil stones often (even though I do not feel them), I thought it was the same and would go away. One and half months later, the feeling became stronger, and whenever I swallow, I felt something on my left tonsil. When I looked in the mirror, I could see some redness and a few small veins close to my tonsil on the left side of my throat, and the tonsil itself was a little swollen and red. I made an appointment with an ENT doctor. He examined with the light and did not see anything unusual, so he suggested that it is nothing remarkable. Since I was very nervous about the constant feeling for more than a month, he felt my tonsils with his fingers and said if it was cancer, he could feel it and assured me that it is not anything significant. After two weeks, I still feel the same sensation of food being stuck on the top back of my left tonsil, but stronger and itchy. I looked in the mirror last night and noticed a big white circle on the top of my left tonsil. I have no fever, no pain in my ear or my tonsils, and no flu symptoms.

{"context": "Suggest treatment for gum bleeding with diabetes", "input": "My tongue feels burnt. Has felt this way for about a week, and I do not recall burning it. There are bumps (the same color as my tongue) along the edges of the surface of my tongue. It is not painful but is uncomfortable. My sense of taste has gone down some. My tongue also feels as though it is bigger and therefore I feel as I am producing more saliva. Can you tell me what this may be and how to treat it if possible? Thanks!", "output": "Good home dental care and routine dental exams are important.The mouth has a natural flora and an imbalance of bacteria can cause changes you describe. Acidophilus can help prevent or reestablish this balance. By prescription, your dentist may need to recommend Nystatin to treat an oral yeast infection. A dry mouth can cause a change in the surface of the tongue and a burning sensation. While you are aware of the discomfort you may try to produce more saliva or this extra saliva may be a reaction to the feeling oh something more in your mouth. Are you aware of grinding your teeth or mouth breathing at night? Stress can bring this on. Rinsing with warm salt water has a soothing and cleansing affect. Avoid spicy foods. Antiinflammatory medications and an antihistamine such as Benedryl may help reduce signs of inflammation.A sinus infection with post nasal drip or acid reflx may cause more acid in the mouth. Irritants such as this, smoking or a sudden change in your habits could affect the tongue as you describe.Evaluate if you have made any changes in products used or diet that may be responsible for an allergic reaction. Stop the use and look for improvement.You may have trauma to the side of your tongue from it being in the way, pushing against your teeth or even biting the edge. any disturbance to the surface of the tongue may affect your taste buds.A dental exam would evaluate for abnormalities or growths. The back border of the tongue should be closely inspected for any suspicious changes to tissue that could be cancerous.A blood test can check the function of your organs and disclose deficiencies that may be responsible for some of these symptoms. I hope some of my suggestions help with a diagnosis. I would be glad to answer additional questions."}

On the 19th day of the post-exposure prophylaxis, I had vaginal sex with my girlfriend. The next day, I had a fourth-generation HIV test, and the result was negative.

What is your suggestion about this? Is there any chance of transmission of HIV from me to my girlfriend? How accurate is a fourth-generation HIV test? Do my girlfriend need to have post-exposure prophylaxis? . .", "output": "The chances of transmission of HIV human immunodeficiency virus by a single unprotected intercourse is low. Postexposure prophylaxis PEP initiated within 24 hours is a very good sign though not 100 percent protective. If the person is HIVnegative, then you need not worry. Fourthgeneration HIV test is considered almost conclusive after one month of exposure and not on the 19th day. Therefore, the chances of HIV tests coming positive later are low. The risk of HIV transmission is very low for your girlfriend also. You can discuss with your doctor for further risk assessment and the need for PEP. If required, PEP must be initiated as early as possible, not after 72 hours of exposure."}

I have terrible dental anxiety (my blood pressure goes up just thinking of going to the dentist) that I really do not want to go through all this if I do not have to. I did some research and it sounds much more involved than I think I can handle, not to mention the cost involved. I am 51 and not really worried about having an implant put in because of the cost as well. What I want to know is what would happen if I do not get the sinus lift? Will it eventually calm down or will it get worse? Before I agree to this procedure, I really want to know all my options. I understand that dentists believe that implants are the best but this is an involved procedure that costs a lot of money and downtime that I really cannot afford.", "output": "Hi. Well, if the sinus is low, then sinus lift procedure is a must to place an implant. Without sinus lift, an implant cannot be placed. It is a surgical procedure that can be very effectively done by an oral surgeon or a trained implantologist, so you need not be so worried about it. Can you please tell what do you have just irritation in the extraction area or there are associated symptoms like pain on the cheek around the nose or nasal congestion, etc.? Also, upload the Xray so that I can advise you more precisely. Please revert back with answers."}

I m desperate!!!", "output": "hi..thanks for your query.. Darker lips do not indicate smoking alcohol intake as frequently believed A lot of people have it genetically predetermined,although parents maymay not have it. A frequent cause of non genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks coloured balmsgloss , as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time.So try and not use it too often..If you have to use it,then let it be allegen free and replace them every 2 months.I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day..that helps in reducing further darkening.Also use a cream containing kojic acid twice a day for lightening of lip colour.U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 1530 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster.

There can be multiple factors producing this condition which are included in day to day life and some times it is really difficult to find one exact cause. In your case you are correlating it with exercises, hot climate,spicy food.

So I did colonoscopy which showed that he has Rectum Cancer & it is just 3~5 centimeters from the anus. 2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, found the cancer is WILD TYPE & not localized & some nodes(which are doubtful)  are seen in the liver, lungs as well in the prostates. 3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So doctors advised to check him for the targeted(Neo-adjuvant) therapy & sent the biopsy to the laboratory & found that he is suitable for ERBITUX-600mg doses. 4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now total 4 chemos (FOLFOX with ERBITUX) is done & patient\u2019s health seems to be well responding. 5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again doctors are advising to have the Sonography. 6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doctors saying is that he will try to kill the doubtful nodes, will shrink the tumor which is present in the rectum & it will be easy to operate on it.

This is the standard therapy for stage 4 rectal cancer. The chances of cure in stage 4 rectal cancer with full treatment is 25, i.e. 25 patients will fully recover while rest will not. Cancer is not a contagious disease and does not spread from one to another by touch or contact. Touching him, playing with him, eating in the same plate does not put you at risk. Sonography is not at all enough to detect the response to the chemotherapy. You need to get a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. As to the life span, it will depend upon the response to chemotherapy. If he is a good responder, and all of his disease is subsequently removed by surgery, then he has a 1 in 4 chance of living his normal life. Else, his lifespan will be 612 months."}

I recommend observing whether you develop such symptoms after consuming milk and, if so, consider switching to a different type of milk. Cow milk is generally lighter and welltolerated. Avoiding red chillies in your diet might also be helpful. As a general health tip, try having lemon with lukewarm water every morning. If the above measures do not bring relief, you can try taking tablet Metrogyl 400 mg Metronidazole twice a day for five days. However, it is crucial to consult a specialist doctor, discuss your symptoms with them, and seek their consent before starting any medication."}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}
{"context": "A mole under my knee cap area became itchy and turned dark after a week. Why?", "input": "I recently have a new situation on my right leg, just under the knee cap area. I am 35-year-old, and for my whole life, I thought I had a mole there. Still not sure if it is an actual mole or not. It is mostly flat, with a normal dark color similar to a mole and in size similar to an average mole as well. At times it is a little dry and a bit scaly, as if you could kind of peel off a little bit of the edges (although not possible, as it will cause normal damage you would expect). Other than this, it had zero issues my whole life. I do not even have any old pictures of it, as it never caught my special attention. Until the past one and a half months or so, the area started to have a little itch. Nothing too crazy, but the itch is something new, and maybe happens one to two times, during every one to two days, for just a brief moment. I give it a quick casual scratch surrounding the mole area without actually scratching directly on the mole to prevent damage. After about a week since the itch started, I finally decided to take a look, and it seems like that mole is gone or came off. Now there is a flat dark mark remaining, and a new scab or crust starting to form around it, and it is getting bigger as time pass. I have never experienced this before. There is no pain or anything other than the same occasional itch that only just recently began. I do not recall anything specific that happened, other than around the same time I started using a new sunscreen. I do not use sunscreen much at all in the past, but I did purchase a new one around a couple of months ago and had just used it only once on that area so far, not sure if it is related or not. I started taking photos of it for one month and began documenting how it is progressing once every few days. I am attaching the pictures for your reference. What is the issue? Kindly give your opinion.", "output": "I also appreciate the detailed history of progression and very nice photographic documentation attachments removed to protect the patients identity. The condition is known as Meyerson nevus, other names are Meyerson phenomenon or halo dermatitis, or halo eczema. As the name suggests, there develops an eczematous response around a preexisting, mostly benign melanocytic nevus in this condition. The periphery is more prominent than the immediate area surrounding the nevus. It can happen with few other conditions as well, besides the nevus. The exact cause is unknown, but it is supposed to be an immune response. Sunburn or chemotherapy can precipitate in some cases. Dermatitis itself can last for few weeks to few months and might lead to slight hypopigmentation around the nevus. You can apply a midpotency steroid cream like Mometasone to reduce the erythema and itching. However, when the condition subsides eventually, the nevus remains unchanged. I hope this was helpful."}

I was put on medrol dose pack on June 3 (when radiation stopped), but continue with severe diarrhea, weight loss, and severe abdominal pain and cramping ( despite GI muscle relaxants).  What can I do?", "output": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Colon is another name of large bowel and rectum is terminal end of colon. Therefore colon and rectal cancer is dealt similarly and called colorectal cancer. Surgery is the first treatment choice depending on the disease location and spread. For cancer that is limited to the affected are in large bowel then surgery is first done. After this chemotherapy and radiation therapy is advised. Some people might develop adverse effect to cancer medicine and then other agents can be used.Colorectal cancer patients must follow up with their doctors regularly and you must also do that. About half the patients of colorectal cancer might develop lesions in liver, lungs, abdomen and brain. Therefore getting ultrasound scan abdomen and CT scan is most important for you as recommended by your doctor. There is also a serum blood marker called CEA and this tells the chance of spread to liver if it increases in amount. This can be known through a simple blood test. Please do not worry."}

There is a little brown discharge seen. In this situation, I am very much concerned about what will happen next? Will it be a miscarriage for the third time? Please help.", "output": "We consider toxoplasmosis when IgM are positive, it meas the person has an active infection. When IgG are positive, it means you are protected from future infection. Your wife is in her first week of pregnancy, so spotting is a common finding due to implantation. Vomiting is also common until 12 weeks. She does not have to worry about it. She can try small frequent meals, baked bread, etc. I recommend an ultrasound at five or six weeks to evaluate the wellbeing of pregnancy. The symptoms that you prescribe does not mean that it will be a future miscarriage. It is common in every pregnancy. If this pregnancy terminate spontaneously, then after that you have to perform several examinations. But I recommend you to be positive. Ultrasound scan."}

{"context": "How long does it take to recover from cervical polyp removal?", "input": "I have scheduled surgery to remove a small cervical polyp and at the same time, my period is due. Should I rearrange? Also how long after removal should I wait before having sex again?.", "output": "I am here to provide expert opinions on your medical issues. It is always better to postpone any procedures, anywhere in your body when you are on your period. It will be difficult for the doctor too, as the bleeding will keep interfering with the clear margins or any small adjacent polyps. It will be better for you too, as during periods you will be a bit tired, it will be exaggerated by the procedure. During periods the blood flow to the uterus is high and any procedure will cause more blood loss. Usually, the removal of the polyp is a simple method, where the polyp is just rotated many times till the root gets cut on its own. So there will not be significant bleeding too. Avoid sex for 7 to 10 days minimum. Better you rearrange the procedure to 3 to 6 days after the period has fully stopped. I hope this has helped you."}

I'm nervous now because I have not gotten my period for October. While I can have an irregular cylce I usually get my period within the first 2 weeks of the month. What are the chances that i could be pregnant?", "output": "Hi, Vasectomy reduces the chance of fertilisation completely as its a surgical method for avoiding pregnancy. As you have used condom also you need not worry about pregnancy. It might be that the periods are getting irregular. You can wait for a week and get a pregnancy testing kit for checking your human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the body which usually increases a week after conception. Take care.

{"context": "Can you look at my MRI and explain the reason for burning pain in feet?", "input": "Hi doctor, I have had a problem with my feet now for four years. About four years ago, I had some burning pain in feet. I cannot stand for more than 15 minutes or the pain gets very bad. Four years ago, I also had really bad pain in my legs after standing all day. That has diminished and now I still have the pain in the bottom of my feet. I have seen a million doctors for this and no one has an answer for me. I have narcolepsy. My neurologist asked me to get an MRI of brain and lower back and said everything looks fine. Actually, she is a sleep specialist. So, I need a second opinion for my MRI report. My regular medication includes Xyrem, Zoloft and Nexium. I also think I have an issue with my upper spine as I am having pain in my neck. I think the pain is due to pinched nerve since moving my head in one direction hurt pretty bad and a few days later the pain would go away. This happened a lot in the past and I just ignored it as it goes away in a few days. Can you look at my MRI? Thank you.", "output": "Hi. I am sorry that you have had this pain for the past four years. From what you have written, I find that you have problem with feet for four years, burning pain on the bottom of feet and you cannot stand for more than 15 minutes. Your MRI report  findings are as follows Based on these, the pain in your feet can be due to two possibilities. Peripheral neuropathy, probably due to diabetes or due to Sodium oxybate Xyrem or compression of nerves in the spinal column. The diagnosis can be fixed by clinical examination of motor, power and sensory system and reflexes followed by nerve conduction study. This will tell whether the problem is in the nerves of your legs and feet or whether the problem is in the spinal cord. You may also need to do a glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes. Even though, Oxybate can cause peripheral neuropathy, diabetes is a more common cause. I would suggest that you at least evaluate your blood glucose levels, so that we can start treatment for the pain. 1. Peripheral neuropathy, probably due to diabetes or due to Sodium oxybate Xyrem. 2. Compression of nerves in the spinal column. 1. Clinical Examination of motor, power and sensory system and reflexes. 2. Nerve conduction study. 3. Glucose tolerance test."}

In 1998 I gave birth to the baby boy in 7th month i.e. premature delivery due high BP and Albumin, then in 2001 I gave birth to the baby girl, BP was high but controlled also and everything went well. Then in 2005 I again gave birth to the baby boy in the beginning of the nineth month, but the baby swalloed the liquor and could not survive more than 4 days. Then in last year 2009, I again gave birth to the baby boy which was aborted in the 7th month as I had an eclimsia attack, but htis time my BP was in control, and suddenly I had a pain in my stomach and BP raised to 226/220. As all the parts had stopped working and only heart was working, According to PGI, Chandigarh doctors I was dead. Now the question is that last year my husband was having some BP problem, then we meet some cardiologist, he asked me that do You (I) have problem during the pregenecy, I said yes My BP is very high and whereas in my family history there is BP patient.Then he said sometimes it happens due to genetic problem and it can be because of my husband also. Is this a genetis problem? If yes, then I wish like to concieve again and then can I go for artificial insemination or is there any other solution. Hope to hear soon from you..... Ashima (India) YYYY@YYYY", "output": "dear ahima, its unfortunate you had to go through such a hard time through your pregnancies. let me help you understand some things.1. high blood pressure during pregnancy with a seizure attack and from what looks like multi organ failure according to your descriptionin your previous pregnancy, puts you under extremely high risk to manage your pregnancy safely. you must understand the consequences of future pregnancy on your own health and wellbeing the functioning of all important organs like heart, brain, kidney, liver may be compromised and can be even fatal or lifethreatening before attempting one. so you must be fully aware and equipped for any potential consequences of it.2. there could be many reasons why high blood pressure happens in pregnancy. some women who have a family history of hypertension, and have crossed 35 years are more susceptible to it. and a number of genes are suspected to cause it. yes, as the baby shares genes of both mother and father, now you can think your body is temporarily handling your husbands genes. hypertension can develop if your husbands genes are not efficiently handled.thats what your doctor explained. this can result in altered placental development and reduced blood supply to the baby. the baby may be thus may be growth restricted, and is prone for premature delivery, and its consequences.3. as even donor insemination may result in similar condition it is extremely hard to predict if that can be free of hypertensive complications.hence, i suggest you to be rational and take a wise decision if you want to conceive again and obtain very good prenatal care when you attempt it. hope this information helped. good luck."}

For allergy, I would prescribe you to use Mometasone furoate Nasonex and Fluticasone furoate nasal spray. To check for bacterial infection, a diagnostic nasal endoscopy must be performed. This test will in turn help us to get information regarding the pathology inside the nose and give us a clear idea as to what is causing the infection to not heal.

I always eat candy non-stop and chips and soda, but I am so addicted that I failed the 30-day sugar free challenge in the first three hours itself. I need help, how can I stop this addiction if all my ways are failing everytime I keep trying.", "output": "Sugar is not an illicit drug, but the brain acts in a similar manner to other substance abuse and addictions. Another reason you could be craving sugar regularly is due to how it makes you feel after consuming it. Generally, a sugary treat causes a rush of both glucose and endorphins in your blood. One of the best things you can do to fight your sugar addiction is to start by swapping sweet foods for healthy alternatives like vegetables. Yes, vegetables can be sweet, but the natural sugars you find in carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and peas are so much lower than what you will find in treats such as gummies, cookies, or donuts. At the same time, they will satisfy your craving for sweetness and you can train yourself to eat these healthier choices overaddictive sugary desserts. The last small tip for fighting your sugar addiction is to generate a plan for how you will eat. You can write this plan out, post it somewhere, or simply keep a mental note of it, but a plan can help you to succeed in various situations. For example, keep carrot sticks cut up in your fridge so that after work, you can plan to snack on those instead of cookies. Or if you are going out to brunch, decide that your plan is to order an omelet with vegetables so that pancakes basically, a maple syrup delivery device is not an option. The idea here is to have a plan for how you will succeed in various scenarios that typically create problems for you."}

It at times is very painful as well as the numbness and stabbing pains.  We are at wits end of what to do next.  Why would it come on so fast.

My oncologist ran blood work and my total bilirubin levels were elevated at 2.0. I understand the normal range is 1.0 I checked old blood work and for like 5 years my levels of bilirubin have been elevated. In 2009, they were 2.0 and 2008, 1.8 and 1.1. What could be the cause of this elevation? What organ should I worry about-- liver? gall bladder? colon? kidney? pancreas? Could it be cancer? I am very worried and don t know how to proceed. Should i consult a gastroenterologist . I am also having a colonoscopy next week? Can they look while i am under anesthesia? What would the procedure be called?", "output": "Hi, to detect particular pathology both direct and indirect bilirubin to be measured separately. then obstructive or hepatocellular jaundice can be ruled out. Breast cancer has a chance to spread to liver causing early changes like increase in bilirubin and SGPT. so you should monitor them closely.

However, I have experienced respiratory side effects (dyspnea) that lead me to discontinue the medication. The side effects are class effect and all drugs from this class will have these effects. I cannot use ACE Inhibitors or ARBs or beta blockers due to asthma. I can only use CCBs and/or diuretics. Regarding CCBs, I have tried Amlodipine but felt much fatigue, then Nifedipine XL that caused intolerable headaches. Then I have been suggested to use Felodipine but it is not available in my country. Finally, I have been prescribed Dilzetem 90 mg BID + low dose Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). However, I can no longer take HCTZ because it causes me severe sciatica. In my country, the medication Clortalidone is not available. What should I take instead of HCTZ? The Diltiazem alone cannot help me. My current blood pressure shows 150/95 mmHg and pulse rate 87 per minute. Should the dose of Diltiazem be adjusted? Or perhaps another medication should be added? Thanks in advance for your response.", "output": "I have reviewed your health query and can understand your worries about hypertension and appropriate medications. Although thorough physical evaluation is mandatory here, I would assist you based on the details provided here. I would suggest you start afresh with lifestyle changes and medications together. You need to get your BMI within normal limits. Every 10 pounds you lose will lower your blood pressure by 5 mmHg. Meanwhile, you need to consult a dietitian to fix your diet according to the healthy lifestyle. You need to take your weight and lipids cholesterol within limits via lifestyle changes. I am sure you can do this but it needs a lot of serious efforts. All medications would then depend on your efforts. If you take control of your weight and cholesterol, you would not need much of medications to lower your blood pressure. Yes, if needed your physician can alter the dosage of Diltiazem according to it until you get your blood pressure within normal limits. Hope it helps."}

{"context": "Will a retainer be effective if it fails to reach the gums?", "input": "I had braces ten years ago. I have been using a retainer after my treatment. Recently I  got a new retainer from a dentist, but it does not reach my gums. Will this still be effective at keeping my teeth straight? .", "output": "Based on your treatment history, your teeth would have settled by now in postorthodontic changes. After completing treatment, it takes approximately 10 to 12 months for your oral cavity to adjust to new positions and for any changes to come into the bestsettled position. All the differences would have happened when you were using your old retainers, and most teeth would be settled. So, new retainers should just maintain the position. It depends on the type of retainer you have been given. A clear aligner retainer should reach sufficiently to the gums and be tight enough to avoid dislodging when doing oral movements. If it is a wire component retainer mostly Hawley or Begg retainers, most of the work will depend on the wire component hence, reaching gums is secondary. However, you have to keep a few points in mind while using them. Are they hurting or pinching you anywhere? Are they too tight to put excess force on teeth? Are they loose enough to cause food lodgement beneath your retainers? If you are facing any such issue, kindly contact us with sufficient details and photos if possible for further solutions."}

Try to replace electrolytes. Dehydration can be very serious if persists and cause stress to the entire body. Vomit is very acidic and irritating to the throat and mouth. Repeat, long term episodes can erode enamel.Thrush will need an antifungal treatment such as the prescription medicine Nystatin. Rinse with warm salt water. Keep up good oral hygiene. Make sure to be cleaning tongue. Try to keep up balanced vitamin intake especially vitamin B complex. Antiinflammatory medicines, acetaminophen or ibuprofen, if tolerated, can reduce discomfort.

What is d best.suplements can i give to her? pls help me for some advice thanku.!", "output": "Breast milk is the best food for a baby upto 6 months of age after which the child needs additional nutrition and hence mashed semi solid food is to be added. Milk becomes an optional food ingredient after 1 year of age provided that adequate nutritive diet is given. At the age of 18 months, the child basically needs a slightly mashed version of adult food low on spices. No need to provide milk or health supplements. Curd or yogurt is helpful. Do not worry about diabetes in a child if the child has proper play habits along with fibre rich diet. Children are picky eaters, so you will have to identify the nutritive food items that the child likes and plan the diet accordingly."}

I smoke about 10 cigarettes a day, have never done recreational drugs and only drink occasionally. 4 months ago I passed 3 kidney stones.  I gave birth to 3 children and had 3 late term miscarriages (4 to 6 mo along).  2 of my children I had to have progesterone shots in order to carry them to term.  After the last one I had severe bleeding issues for over a year causing me to have a partial hysterectomy, I still have my overies.  4 years ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and have been on and off medication since, at times it would be under control without medication.  For 2 years now I have continually been told that I have a high red blood count and have had to undergo a phlembotomy several times because of it.  I currently have high blood pressure, sometimes as high as 190/140 or so.  I have a head ache almost all the time.  I have noticed times that my heart seems to beat very very hard or flutter for short times and it causes tension in my chest.  Different doctors have run so many tests and cant tell me why any of this happens.  They dont know what has caused the high red count.  I also have leg pain and swelling which worsens in cold weather and it doesnt really change with activity or rest, they feel very heavy at times.  Most doctors dismiss this.  I am constantly being asked if I have a sunburn even though I dont.  I sweat horribly bad very often even from the slightest activity such as vacuuming in a 70 degree house.  I am constantly tired no matter how much sleep I get.  I have been diagnosed with minor sleep apnea but the machine doesnt seem to help me.  I deal with months of diarrhea and then turn around and am severely constipated for a couple weeks.

After undergoing urine culture, CECT scan, ultrasound, and all blood tests, it was detected that I have an E. coli bacterial infection.

Additionally, when I walk for about one kilometer, I feel pain in the groin area and find it difficult to walk for more than two kilometers. I also have kidney stones on both sides and a grade II fatty liver. Kindly provide your insight.", "output": "You have bilateral renal pelvic obstruction due to stones and also have diabetes with a urinary tract infection. The pain in the groin is caused by pelvic renal calculi, and the pain can radiate to the groin area. To treat the infection, I suggest you take a tablet of Levofloxacin 500 mg once a day for 14 days and Amikacin 500 mg injections twice a day for 14 days if serum creatinine is less than 1.6 mgdl. Afterward, the stones will need to be cleared bilaterally to fully resolve the infection, as the pus is associated with the presence of stones. Additionally, the stomach upset and abdominal pain you are experiencing are likely due to Nitrofurantoin, which can cause gastritis and acidity. Nitrofurantoin may not be the appropriate choice for treating this infection, but it can be taken for maintenance therapy. I suggest you get your diabetes treated and have your serum creatinine checked once you start the Amikacin injections. The presence of stones can prevent the complete clearance of the infection, so treatment for them is crucial for effective treatment. I suggest you consult a specialist, talk with them and take the medications with their consent. I hope this has helped you. Kindly follow up if you have more doubts."}

Your friend is prescribed a lot of medications I am not sure for what plethora of conditions  I need to understand the exact reasons that she is taking so many medications.

Although a temperature of 100.3 is not a high fever, Tylenol will not only reduce her fever, but it will also help to relieve throat pain.If she is doing her usual activitieswalking, running, acts like she knows who you are, and is not vomiting or dehydrated then her illness is not severe.

{"context": "I took Unwanted 72 within 24 hours of getting sexually intimate. Can I still be pregnant?", "input": "Hello doctor, I got my periods on 18th\u00a0of last month, and I got sexually intimate for the first time on 27th of last month. Although there was no full penetration, I took Unwanted 72 the next day. On 11th of this month, I had little bleeding with a lot of clots that lasted for three days. I normally have a 27 days menstrual cycle which is very regular and have a good flow. I was feeling dizzy and nausea sometimes, so on 18th and 25th of this month,\u00a0I took a\u00a0home pregnancy test which was negative. Can there be any chance of pregnancy? Or can those be the side effects of Unwanted 72? When should I take a home pregnancy test again? Please help as I am very tensed.", "output": "Hi. Let me put you at ease by saying that you will not be pregnant. Let me tell you how. For a young lady with 27 days cycle, ovulation will be on day 13th, and the egg will stay alive for 24 hours. So you are at a risk of pregnancy on 29th to 31st. But your sexual exposure was much before that, so no way your egg was exposed to sperms. The chances are further reduced as there was no ejaculation into the vagina. But if preseminal fluid comes in contact with genitals or thigh there is a slight chance of pregnancy. As you took an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours, the chances of you getting pregnant are very slim. Unwanted 72 will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, which will come out in the form of clots or rather fleshy masses, with mild lower abdomen pain. Even though you felt the bleeding was less, clots means bleeding was more than normal."}

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses."}

Hence you should seek an opinion from your gynaecologist as well. Zoloft is a safer drug for anxiety, but still you should take opinion before taking it on your own. Medical causes are more common etiological causes for anxiety, they must be ruled out first. The symptoms that you are facing these days in morning can be the residual anxiety symptoms. So, before taking any medication for this anxiety, get yourself assessed in detail to rule out any underlying medical cause for the same."}

What to do?", "output": "As you are only 17 years old, the primary cause behind it might be genetic as your parents or grand parents may have white hairs at an early stage. The other possible causes might include poor nutrition, improper lifestyle, stress, etc. White hairs mean lack of melanin, the coloring pigment in hairs. Once the hair that grows white, there are fewer chances to revert them back to normal black color. But, you can stop further graying of hairs. First of all add foods like figs, curry leaves, raisins, fresh fruits, and vegetables in your diet. Avoid excessive caffeinated drinks, spicy and junk food. Quit smoking and drinking if you do. Sleep adequately at least for 6 to 8 hours a day. Try to go to bed before midnight. Avoid taking too much stress. As far as medicine is concerned, I suggest tablet Asthiposhak two tablets twice a day with water for six weeks. Apply Bhringraj oil on your hairs two to three times a week one night before washing hairs. Wash your hairs with a mild herbal shampoo. Have one glass of lukewarm milk and add a pinch of black pepper and turmeric in it and take it before sleeping. Try all these things, and you will soon feel positive results. 1. Genetics. 2. Poor nutrition. 3. Stress."}

I ended up in the ER yesterday bc the pain got to the point that I was shaking and nauseous. Immediately they suspected kidney stones and when it was ruled out from the bloodwork and CT scan, they sent me home with a prescription of painkillers and anti-nausea medicine and told me to FU with my Dr. So, here I am, still in the same pain, even with the pain medicine, which is now radiating up my right shoulder, and across my midback. What should I do?", "output": "Hi  From your history, it seems like an inflammation of the biliary tract or pancreas along with or without a stone in the same, for which I am not aware if an ultrasound was done or not. Stones in the gall bladderCBD are best detected by an ultrasound and may be missed in a CT scan. In your CT may be it was more concentrated on the kidney region. Pancreas pathology may be picked up by either an ultrasound or better with a CT if it was kept in mind. I would suggest you to discuss on this with your treating doctor, who may also advise you for some special blood tests like serum amylase, serum lipase, and liver function test. If you take alcoholic beverages, then this points more towards a hepato biliary and pancreatic problem. Wishing you an early recovery."}

I don t want to convince myself that I m a candidate for dementia. I m not someone who when they read about certain, believe it s what s definitely happening to me.", "output": "Hi, I dont think there is any clear indication of dementia by your account. Cognitive performance may be affected by other issues than dementia. Anxiety and depression are two such common causes which create the false impression of memory impairment but in truth, it is because they affect concentration, not because there is true memory impairment. One other factor apart from anxiety might be the medication, as it may affect cognitive functions, so it might contribute as well. Therefore, dementia wouldnt be the first diagnosis coming to mind. You may have some neuropsychological tests sort of questionnaires administered by doctors or psychologists to test for dementia to make sure, but in the meantime, I see no reason for panic. As for sleeplessness, it is one of the most common manifestations of a manic episode, it is very common. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I understand breathing difficulties can be associated with the cancer spreading into the lungs, however I would have assumed this would occur in a later stage and I would be experiencing other symptoms?I do also have a sore throat and minor swelling bellow my jaw, so it's entirely possible I just have a \"cold\".

Bronchitis is very common after viral upper respiratory tract infection URTI. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles 56 times a day. You will mostly improve with all these. Since you are also having malignant melanoma, pulmonary involvement should be looked for.

What medication can I give her? Please advise. .", "output": "Is the patient a known asthmatic or with food and drug allergies? How was the response to Ambroxol and Allerkid? The cough and cold may be due to an infection viral or bacterial, an allergy, or an asthma attack, among other possible diagnoses. If it is due to an infection, it is usually associated with fever, but it can also present without any fever. If the cause is viral, it will resolve on its own. However, because we are still in a pandemic, COVID19 is also considered. If it is a bacterial infection, then an antibiotic is needed. If the cause is an allergy, the Allerkid Cetirizine may help. If it is an asthma attack, then adding Salbutamol via a nebulizer may help. However, because of her age and the duration of the symptoms, I would really suggest bringing the patient to a doctor so they may be properly examined and the right medicine may be given. It is quite hard to evaluate children because they cannot verbalize how they feel, so I suggest you bring the child to a doctor as soon as possible for proper assessment and treatment. As of now, continue the Allerkid Cetirizine, and you may nebulize with Salbutamol when she coughs but again, please bring the child to a doctor as soon as possible. I hope that was helpful."}

Pregnancy test were negative twice..", "output": "Hi, Please do not worry. Just check if the pregnancy tests were done after the missed period or before it, as those done before missed periods will be most likely negative. If the test was negative after 7 days or more from the missed period, you are not likely to be pregnant. In that case the absence of period is due to I pill and injection that sometimes delays periods. Just wait for your periods after this. If you have not taken a test 7 days after the missed period, get it done using the first morning sample of urine for best results and rule out pregnancy. Also stress delays periods so relax, you have done everything possible and so are most likely safe.Hope this helped. Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

In my opinion she should undergo CT THORAX and Bronchoscopy and BAL  Broncho Alveolar Lavage  analysis for TB, to determine activity of the lesion.No need to give prophylactic anti Tb drug before confirming activity of the lesion.As fibrotic lesion is seen mostly after healing from old infection. So may be she is having only scar lesion and not active lesion.So no need to give anti Tb drugs. Better to consult pulmonologist first and get done CT THORAX and Bronchoscopy to determine activity. And start treatment accordingly."}

I was diagnosed in the emergency room and referred to a urologist . I haven t been able to be seen by the urologist because there is only one office in my area so appointments are hard to come by, let alone even receive a phone call in return. The past few days I thought I possibly had passed the stone without realizing it. However, today I feel as though it is sitting at the opening of my vagina and I feel it more so when I urinate. It is more of an uncomfortable feeling rather than actual pain. Also, I am experiencing what seems to be air bubbles coming from that area. Not passing gas, just very small air bubbles .

Also, what can I expect when the stone actually passes? Will there be a great deal of pain and blood involved?", "output": "Renal stones less than the size of 10mm are flushed out easily without major complications. It occurs in 2 stages  origin till the urinary bladder and from the bladder to outside. Pain, abdominal cramps, bloody urine and discomfort which are usual accompanying symptoms as the stones pass out is found only in the first stage. Second stage is asymptomatic and rarely one can experience flattened stream of urine or double stream urine. From your description, your symptoms are unlikely related to renal stone passing. The discomfort in the vaginal region is probably due to localized infection. Consulting your local gynecologist will be helpful. Drink plenty of fluids and cranberry juice can help in the meantime. Also important is to abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse until complete recovery. Hope this helps. Wish you good health. Regards"}

What should b done hence forth to avoid more complication. And what can happen at worst", "output": "I carefully read your query and I am sorry about your grandmothers health issues.The diagnosis of bilateral infarction would justify her symptoms. A lacunar infarction is small but since you say frontoparietal meaning involving two lobes I guess there must be multiple ones. Those infarctions have already happened now cant take them back but you can reduce the risk of further ones in the future by treating hypertension and high cholesterol you mentioned as well as with aspirin. The risk of her having a stroke will remain significant but by these measures we can lower it.As for the atrophy if severe it could be a sign of dementia, meaning a fall in her higher mental functions like memory, speech, judgement, complex tasks, planning and organizing, etc, if that is a case it is a progressive disease which could progress for years and render the patient unable to take care of herself and immobilized in bed. But Im saying that just because you asked for worse case scenario. At the moment there is no diagnosis of dementia if there are no higher mental signs you have noticed, its not defined by atrophy, atrophy is an aging process which can be found also in old people without dementia.There are many types of dementia, most frequent is Alzheimers disease, but if there is Parkinsonian syndrome it can manifest dementia in advanced stages, as well as imbalance. Regarding the treatment pacitane is used to treat parkinsonian tremor, but you should be careful in old people as at times it cause psychic symptoms like hallucinations, agitation.

Prior to the hospice she had started to use the mind-body approach to revitalize the immune system to heal the cancer.

Since today evening my daughter who is very close with me, has been developing fever, and hence the medicines. Pls advise what would be the best way forward on my daughter s health.", "output": "HI...if your daughter is developing fever in being in contact with you, then it is not malaria and mostly it is viral illness. Viral illness spreads by close contact and malaria spreads by mosquito bites.Now in south India, Dengue is in full swing. I do not recommend the usage of MeftalP which has the side effect of dropping platelet counts, because as such in any viral illness, there can be drop in platelet counts.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesnt require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 47 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mgkgdose every 46th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards  Dr. Sumanth"}

First, you mentioned that you have hypertension high blood pressure. There are some drugs from the dihydropyridine fraction of calcium channel blockers amlodipine, felodipine etc. that cause this as a side effect. If this the case, I suggest you contact your physician and change to a drug from an another class of blood pressurelowering agents. Second, it can be a sign of a failing heart. My opinion is that this is not the case. However, I would recommend an echocardiogram, to assess the motility and function of the heart muscle, as well as the functioning of heart valves. Third, it can be a sign of some sort of damage to the kidneys. Have you ever suffered from kidney stones or other kidney disease? Hereby, I recommend that you get these tests urea, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria. I hope I was helpful. Take care and feel free to ask again. Good day."}

Her parents tell me this is a panic attack and are afraid she is hyperventilating. How can you tell if this is just a tantrum or if she is indeed hyperventilating?", "output": "HelloDr.Ervis answeringTemper tantrums are emotional and physical meltdowns common among children in the 2 to 4yearold age range. The toddler may demonstrate a number of characteristic behaviors, including screaming, kicking, lying on the floor, and occasionally holding her breath rarely to the point of passing out. As a child matures, these manifestations of emotional, developmental, and physical immaturity gradually extinguish themselves. Studies indicate that 2385 of children between 2 and 4 years of age will commonly have temper tantrums.Children who still have tantrums after the age of 4 may need help learning to deal with their emotions. Tantrums that continue or start during the school years may be a sign of learning problems or other issues that the child may need help with.Some children have temper tantrums that last longer and are more severe than normal. They may destroy things or hurt themselves or other people. This violent behavior may be a sign of a more serious problem.If you sense that a tantrum is coming, you may be able to stop it.Distract your child. For example, if your child doesnt like to go to bed, talk about something fun that is going to happen the next day.Encourage your child to take a break from a frustrating activity. Or get your child to focus on something he or she already knows how to do.Remove your child from a situation that is likely to cause tantrums. Situations such as a large family dinner or the lights and noise of a carnival may be too much for a young child to handle.After a tantrum starts, ignoring it may work best. Try the followingWalk away. But stay where the child can see you, especially if your child is very young.Keep doing what you were doing. You can observe without focusing all of your attention on your child.Dont talk to the child, if possible. If you do speak, use a neutral tone of voice.After a tantrum is overPraise your child for calming down.Acknowledge your childs feelings. You might say something like, I know that you were upset because you couldnt tie your shoes.Comfort your child without giving in to his or her demands.Never punish or make fun of a child who has a temper tantrum. Dont use words like bad girl or bad boy to describe your child.Teach other ways to handle anger and frustration. For example, encourage your child to use words to express feelings. Or set up a safe place in the home where your child can go to calm down.Be a good role model. Children learn by watching their parents, so let your child see that you can handle your own strong emotions calmly.If your child has a lot of tantrums, timeout may be an option. Timeout works best for children who can understand why it is being used. This is usually around age 2 or 3 years.For a timeout, you send or put your child someplace safe, such as a chair in a hallway, for a few minutes. This gives the child time to calm down. It also teaches the child that having a temper tantrum is not acceptable behavior."}

Some find a donutshaped pillow works well, and for others it is not the right shape and still puts pressure on the coccyx. Many prefer a foam pillow that is more of a Ushape or Vshape with the back open so nothing touches the coccyx. Any type of pillow or sitting arrangement that keeps pressure off the coccyx is ideal.If the tailbone pain is caused or increased with bowel movements or constipation, then stool softeners and increased fiber and water intake is recommended.avoid forward bendingavoid driving and traveling for long distancedo back execises tooStretching.

My recent MRV shows it completely effaces flow related signal and enhancement from a segment of the superior sagittal sinus. It measures a little greater than 3.5 cm in length. There is prominent bilateral cortical venous collateralization coursing posteriorly over the mass to converge with patent sinus at the vertex. There is no cortical venous hypertension. Major dural sinuses otherwise are widely patent. I have done a lot of research over the years and understand quite a bit but I would like an interpretation of what this means.", "output": "arterial side of the mass. In your case the number of collateral veins additional anatomical veins not usually present in people WITHOUT meningiomas that have developed over time is sufficient and their pathways appear to properly drain into the STRAIGHT SINUS so there is no BACKUP or CONGESTION of bloodflow simply on the part of the meningioma. There is a REROUTING of venous blood in the area, however, of the mass lesion itself and thats expected which is what the effacement of flow means in the 3.5cm trajectory of the superior sagittal sinus i.e. no significant blood flow is found in that part of the egress channel. In other words, your meningioma is trucking along peacefully without really disturbing the OUTFLOW or egress of the blood from its location such that oxygenation, nutrition, and metabolic waste can still be properly exchanged and executed as if it werent there.

On the 19th day of my cycle, I had unprotected sex till the 28th day of my cycle. I am having cramps and spotting but not having my periods. Kindly suggest.", "output": "It is possible that the cramps and spotting you are experiencing could be related to your menstrual cycle, but it is also possible that they could be side effects from the Ipill you took in the last month or related to the unprotected sex you had in this month. The Ipill is a form of emergency contraception that can cause irregular bleeding or spotting as a side effect. It is possible that the bleeding you experienced this month was a result of taking the Ipill, and that your current symptoms are also related to it. However, it is also possible that the unprotected sex you had this month could have led to a pregnancy, and the symptoms you are experiencing now could be early signs of pregnancy. Cramping and spotting can occur during early pregnancy as the fertilized egg implants in the uterus. It is important to take a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy if you are sexually active and experiencing unusual symptoms. Feel free to contact me for further queries.

Usually this kind of pain is possible with major ovarian cyst removal for few days but here since its long time over and still she is suffering with pain then I suggest to take secondary opinion. I suggest to do one more ultrasound abdomen and check on abdominal possible issues. If this is normal then you need to take MRI of lumbosacral spine and check report of it. Here if there is major problem with disc or nerve related issue then orthopedic doctor may ask for surgical correction followed by physiotherapy treatment. But if there is no major problem at lower spinal level then you can take her to physiotherapy treatment and along with that take postural suggestion as well spinal exercises. All together this will definitely help her. You can also ask her to use hot and cold pack for her back at painful area for some more pain relief.But if there is problem detected at abdominal level then I suggest as per the issues you need to take specialist suggestion.Remember for conservative management physiotherapy will help but proper diagnosis is also very important for long term relief.Take care."}

Thanks,  Danny", "output": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The metallic taste can be secondary to the drugs or medications taken for tooth infection particularly metronidazole.

Once the antibiotics are stopped, the metallic taste will come down. You have to get the crown replaced with ceramic crown.I hope my answer will help you, take care."}

The description of your rash, does match that of an allergic rash, but there are many more rashes that do still match your current presentation as well. I would advice you to visit any physician, and show him the rash, as a rash has to almost always be inspected by a physician or dermatologist before prescribing treatment. I am from India too, and as we have the privilege of having many clinics, in almost every nook and corner of our Indian streets, consulting any one of these doctors should help you, as they can help give you immediate relief from your problem. If it is an allergic reaction, a shot of an antihistamine antiallergic medicine, should give you relief in 15 minutes maximum. I hope this has helped you to find the right treatment option. Wishing you a speedy recovery and good health from there on."}

Strange thing! They dont clear up, they just keep coming back. They are not itchy, just super annoying and ugly, and wont go away.

I do not smoke. I am not even an occasional drinker. My thyroid hormone levels are normal. I am not a diabetic, but my weight is 103 kg and my height is 5'7\". I walk around 5 km for five days a week. I have been working in shift for the past 15 years. I am working as a senior engineer with full competence, but with little nervousness. I experienced delusions alone and not hallucinations when I was broken down for first time before 16 years when I was studying post graduation. Earlier than that, I used to suffer from severe anxiety. Before 8 years, with a doctor's prescription, I reduced Risperidone 1 mg to 0.5 mg and Escitalopram 10 mg.

I am sorry to hear about your mental state, but at the same time I do appreciate you for being on regular medicines. However, even though your question is very direct, I am sorry to say that I cannot give you a straight forward answer or diagnosis. First and most importantly, I implore you not to go chasing after a specific diagnosis as the DSM Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and other books that are used for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. They keep changing some criteria every decade or so. Hence, as long as you have understood that you have delusions which get better with regular treatment, that it is more insight than most people with your condition. Secondly, I cannot figure out why you want to link your daughters career with your diagnosis. Please do let her live her own life. Though there is a genetic risk of schizophrenia in her, it is in no way a certainty. Now, coming to your actual question, if the delusions that you had were deemed bizarre by your treating psychiatrist, he would be right in fitting you into a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia even if you have not had any sort of hallucination. So, it would depend on the content of your delusions too. Apart from delusions and hallucinations, there are a variety of other criteria too, like disorganized speech or behavior or negative symptoms, which could give you a diagnosis of schizophrenia. So, once again, I would like to end my response saying that it would be best if you discuss the reason for your diagnosis with your treating psychiatrist. But, please do not let it affect your daughters future in any manner. Take care.

I suggest having a detailed discussion with your psychiatrist and sorting this out. This is essential as we need to establish temporal correlation and make out the likely cause for the problem.

I have a three year old daughter who has a tooth infection (she had chipped both her two front teeth in September and they just began hurting on Saturday). We saw a dentist and they determined the teeth were infected and need to be removed (we have an appointment for Wednesday for this). To treat the infection we were given amoxicillin and ibprofen for pain. At the time we went in for the dental appointment there was a small pimple-like bump on my daughter s gum and her upper lip was very swollen. Now (5 days later), her gum has what looks like a blister as well as the pimple above her tooth, but her lip is not as swollen. This is the first time I have given her amoxicillin and I wanted to verify that it is working, also, does it normally smell a bit rotten (first time dealing with it)?", "output": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The blister like structure over the gums and swollen lip is because of the abscess formation secondary to tooth infection.

{"context": "My persistent heartburn has not healed even after taking medicines for more than 1 month. Why?", "input": "Hi doctor,  I have persistent heartburn related symptoms for the last four to five months. I visited a gastro and he prescribed me medicines for 14 days. My conditions got better but not fully cured, so I was given another 14 days of medicine (including a proton-pump inhibitor). Soon the lockdown kicked in and I went back to my home. I meanwhile took Ayurvedic medicines for a month here. While it has reduced the duration of heartburn episodes, the problem has not gone yet. For the last month, I have mild heartburn (pain in chest) for 20-60 minutes in a day (spread across three to four intervals). 14/30 days my throat felt different. 7/30 last days had acid refluxes. But heartburn occurs daily. I have tried varying my diet, but have not found any significant changes. Is this a cause of concern that despite having medicines for 42 days, I still have mild heartburns occurring daily? What should I do? How long will it take for a medicine to show the effect? Should I continue the course and if so, for how long? And if yes, does prolonged usage of medicine have side effects? Or if left untreated, do they have side effects? I took Somproz initially for four days, Lesuride-25, and Deltone for 14 days, and for the next 14 days I took Lesuride 25 and Nexpro 40.", "output": "You have briefly and well described your history, and I understand that you have very genuine concerns. So, the problem you have is called gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD. This is basically reflux of acid from the stomach to food pipe causing heartburn, sore throat, sometimes cough, and shortness of breath. Our stomach produces approximately 1 liter of acidic juices to help digest food. The acid produced does not usually come into food pipe unless someone has loose sphincter at the lower end of our food pipe which prevents acid refluxing into the food pipe. There are two further classifications of GERD. PPI responsive GERD, and PPI refractory GERD. Your symptoms suggest that you have PPI proton pump inhibitor responsive GERD since your symptoms are significantly improved when you are taking PPI. Even in PPI responsive GERD the symptoms may not completely vanish but are declined to a reasonable level and this may be in your case. For this, you just need to increase the dose of PPI. Instead of once daily dose, you can start taking it twice a day before meals. The rest of your symptoms like sore throat will go away once your acid reflux is suppressed well. Diet may or may not affect the GERD. However, there are certain precautions that you can do to prevent heartburn. Avoiding large volume meals, instead, take small but frequent meals. Avoid taking large meals at night or before going to bed. Give at least three to four hours gap after night meals before going to bed for sleeping. Raise the head end of your bed by placing a cement or wooden block down the head side of your bed. Or there are commercially available antireflux mattresses that can be used instead. Avoid wearing tightfitting clothes and belts. So taking a daily pill to control your acid production is the only effective way of treating your condition. No long term use and side effects. Well, all PPI are relatively safe and do not cause significant side effects if taken for years and years. However, there are studies that have shown renal damage, bone protein loss, and aspiration pneumonia but in practice, these side effects are not that common as elaborated in studies. The one daily pill to control your acid and prevailing a normal lifestyle is much more important than unforeseen and often unestablished side effects from long term use of PPI. I would recommend if PPI helps you to do well then there is no reason for stopping for the sake of unforeseen complications. PPI responsive GERD. Ambulatory 24 hours PHimpedance testing. Nonerosive reflux disease. GERD. Tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast. You can increase it to 40 mg BID before meals. Follow up if want to discuss more."}

Does the area of lump itches or always seems to be wet? It does not seem to be like a typical external hemorrhoid. It needs a physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Actually these are a collection of engorged small blood vessels and nearby soft tissue which occurs due to the pooling of blood due to prolonged constipation, straining, etc. Hemorrhoids can be avoided by encouraging more oral fluids, avoiding constipation, straining exercises especially abdomen, fiberrich diet, etc. You most probably need to visit a general surgeon. Also, you might just need a minor surgical procedure. You no need to get worried. You can get discharged in two to three days from the hospital.

I honestly feel pressure in the rectum that is constant and it s a very strange unfamiliar feeling. I ve had a pain in my upper hamstring (believed to be caused by running). It was high up where your thigh meets your buttocks, so at first I was wondering if there was some connection between this which preceded the feeling of pressure in my rectum. Thank you.", "output": "Due to excessive loss of water during the run practice in the form of sweat and other metabolism there may be a chance for the hard stools. For this I will advice to eat the fruits more to balance the fluid intake and output.Now coming to your hamstring, if I has got a pull or a tear we need an assessment of the muscle to be performed. Also intially you have to stop training first as it will aggrevate the muscle fibres to not heal and later it may trouble more. Also, undergoing proper physical therapy before training is advised to get the maximum output from the muscle.I deal with sports cases regularly and prevention is better than cure for the longer runs. with physical therapy they respond well and perform better in a later stage of sports.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"}

Remember all those olden days when your mother struggled to make you eat all those vegetables and nutritious menu. Now history repeats itself. The behavior of your child is quite normal. One reason for this is for many picky eaters sensory processing plays a big role in their refusal to eat foods. Simply put, if something feels gross in their mouth or on their hands, they arent going to eat it. The fancy therapeutic term we give for this is tactile defensive. I strongly believe that structure and routine around food and meal time is critical to kids eating well. I suggest you to stick to routine. Never ever provide any food or drinks except water to the child other than in the structured time. Let the child come and tell you that she is hungry. Let her eat herself. Remove all play items, TV from nearby. Provide her food she likes most. Nutrition can be provided through drinks.

{"context": "How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine?", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

I also have a partially erupted wisdom tooth in that part. I read about TMJ on the internet and I am getting anxiety because of it. I am very afraid. Recently, the jaw got torn I think and I could not put my teeth together on the left side. It healed after five days of taking Zerodol-MR. I do not know what to do. Please advise as I am constantly thinking about it.", "output": "Hi. There is nothing to be afraid of. You seem to have recurrent disc displacement. The main cause can be the one you mentioned, your halferupted tooth. I suggest you get it removed and make sure you eat from both the sides. The joint gets stressed if you eat from only one side and that causes lockjaw.If you have any cavity get it filled as soon as possible. Make sure during wide mouth opening to hold your jaw with your hand in front of the eye. Check TMJ exercises on the internet and do it in front of the mirror daily. You will get healed within months."}
{"context": "What could cause numbness in the genital area and anus?", "input": "I am a 28-year-old single male and a labor worker. It has been about three months now that my genital area and anus area got numb. It all started when I got back from work with a pinching sensation under my left scrotum when I sat down on the floor. I went to sleep that night thinking it was nothing, but the next day when I went to work, I noticed this strange sensation like it was burning. I thought it was some rash from my clothes, but when I reached home, I noticed that I could not feel the left side of my penis and scrotum. I went to the doctor and explained, but he said it was just a fungus skin infection and prescribed me some anti-fungus cream, but it did not help with the burning. He also tested me for STD and sugar levels, but everything was normal. I even got my prostatectomy checked, and it was normal. That night I went to the restroom to masturbate, and when I was about to ejaculate, I flexed my pelvic muscles. I felt this pinch sensation under my right scrotum. That was when my penis, scrotum, and anus lost sensation. When I walk, it feels a stinging and burning sensation. I feel like I am wearing really tight undergarments, and my penis sometimes aches. When I sit down, it feels as if I am ejaculating mostly on the left side. My doctor also checked my testosterone and cholesterol levels. The testosterone came back a little low, but my cholesterol came back high. I doubt this could be the cause of my problem. It all happens really fast, and I also feel gassy. I would like to know if I pinched a nerve. How can I treat this? Will I recover from this?", "output": "Your symptoms are really different and unique as you have a burning sensation and also not feeling anything on the left side of your penis and scrotum. Penis and scrotum areas are supplied by different nerves, the dorsal nerve of the penis and the genitofemoral nerves, respectively. If there is no skin lesion, there are a few vague possibilities, such as nerve inflammation or nerve root compression at the origin of the spine. Do you have any urinary incontinence also? 2. Do you have any stool incontinence? 3. Do you have any back pain? 4. Is there any numbness in the leg or thigh?"}

All other symptoms of pregnancy appear only after ten to fifteen days of misse period. So, do not go on those symptoms. Get the pregnancy diagnosed by reliable test.

I am not overweight and I look normal.", "output": "Hallow Dear,To start with, let me discuss about the medicines you have been prescribed. Registrone is a retroprogestational medicine which helps controlling the excessive bleeding or inducing the withdrawal bleeding when taken for short period. If taken continually cyclically, it helps regularising the menses without affecting the ovulation. Folinz tablets are tablets of Folic Acid and Zinc. They help the healthy growth of the tissues. Siocare Syrup is an Ayurvedic medicine which is used for the treatment of Menstrual problems, Bleeding Gynaecological conditions, Reproductive system problems, Bleeding disorders, Diarrhoea, Eye disorders and other conditions. Siocare Syrup contains Ashwagandha, Asoka, Chandan, Daruharidra, Dashmoola, Dhataki, Guduchi, Jeeraka, Lodhra, Musta, Shatavari, and Udumbara as active ingredients. Now let us turn to your main issue of fertility and the irregular menstruation. By and large, the women with irregular menstruation are known to face problems in egg release however, it is not a rule. If you are overweight also, having hairiness at the unwanted places of the body along with irregular menses, please check for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which is known to have ovulation problem and result in infertility. At this stage, I would advise you to monitor your ovulation. Ultrasonography would be option of choice for this. If you find evidence of egg release, you should not be concerned about conception problems. Try to plan your pregnancy at and around the day of egg release to achieve the pregnancy. If ultrasonography reveals the failure of ovulation, you will have to undergo treatment of ovulation induction. Please report to your Gynaecologist. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"}

{"context": "Suggest remedies for a dog bite", "input": "My daughter was diagnosed with mononucleosis about 3 weeks ago. So far, except for theytypcial raging sore throat for 3 days and lymph nodes still swollen, she has experienced little discomfort. However, 2 days ago she started to find little raised bumps on her face and thought it might be pimples from bronzing cream she had used. She now has them on her arms, ears and bottom of her feet. Not red, more skin coloured and not really itchy. Could this rash be from the mono virus?", "output": "I read your query and I understand your concerns.Yes, this rash be from the mono virus. The common symptoms usually consist of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy, but sometimes a rash could be present. Mono rash is a common symptoms experienced when affected with mononucleosis. It usually develops on 7 to 10 days after treatment with betalactam antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalosporins. Typically this rash is tan or brownish in color. Since the color is quite different than the typical very red allergictype rash, this should not be misinterpreted as a penicillin allergy.If such rashes appear then it is a clear indication of hypersensitivity reaction to antibiotic. However, this is not a real allergy and does not mean that the person is allergic to such medications. This rash indicates a hypersensitivity reaction to the antibiotic. If the antibiotic is given later on in the absence of EBV infection the reaction doesnt occur, so it is not a true allergy. However, because the shape and distribution of the rash of infectious mononucleosis plus antibiotics are similar to an allergictype rash, they could be often confused by patients and clinicians.Hope I helped with my answer.

You should understand, that nasal polyps grow only in inflamed tissue of the nasal mucosa. The mucosa is wet. During an infection or allergic reaction, the nasal mucosa becomes loose, swollen and red, and produce fluid that drips out. With continued irritation, this mucosa may form a polyp.Although some people can develop polyps with no previous nasal problems,because they have hereditary tendency for develop polyps. often there is a trigger for developing polyps. These triggers includechronic sinusitis bronchial asthma allergic rhinitiscystic fibrosisChurgStrauss syndrome with high level of Ig ENSAID sensitivity an allergylike response to aspirin, ibuprofenThey checked your son for allergy and cystic fibrosis, in addition i propose to check him for infection and do throat culture for flora and sensitivity to antibiotic .

The third time my mother went in to the office, she could not hold the liquid. My mother decided to stop everything and eat organic foodstuffs and try to heal herself with holistic remedies.

Blood in urine is quite common symptoms of bladder cancer. Warferrin should not be taken. It will increase the bleeding.

{"context": "What are the side effects of radiation used in lithotripsy?", "input": "I am 24 years old. I had my kidney stone removed a year ago for causing mild hydronephrosis at my right kidney. During the treatment, I was exposed to full of radiation, abdominal CT scan, lithotripsy, fluoroscopy, and another fluoroscopy during stent insertion. I am not sure how the doctor manages the radiation. I did my treatment abroad and it is not really a well-developed country. He might not even care bout it. I studied some about radiation when I was in dental school so I am very scared of the side effects. So if I am to have another case of hydronephrosis, should I just remove the kidney rather than undergoing such radiation which may cause me high risk of future cancer? Because as you can see, I am still so young and I just started my career. What do you suggest? Do the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa? Is there another less risky treatment in terms of radiation? How about invasive treatment? Is the risk higher aside from the slow healing? And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.", "output": "There are enough studies and literature which prove that though there is radiation exposure during CT computed tomography scan in the removal of kidney stone it is in low dose and chances of cancer do not increase. So do not worry about that. I do not think removing kidney to escape from radiation exposure is a good option. You should not think of that. If there is again stone formation then there is a treatment called ultrasoundguided lithotripsy ESWL which can break your stone from outside without any radiation exposure. So you can do ESWL extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy if required later but no need to remove the kidney."}

Is he routinely exposed to passive smoke, any other smokesfumesdusts or air pollution?Above details would help me to know more about your son and therefore to make suggestions for him more specifically.At present, from your provided history, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows1. Foracort is a preventive type of inhaler. If he requires nebulization often, then regular foracort inhaler would help him to prevent repeated attacks of breathing problems.2. If he does not have frequent attacks, using rescue types of inhalers or nebulization with salbutamol or levosalbutamol will be useful.3.

Regarding future asthma, no it is not always and cannot be predicted at this age. Usually most of the children improve by age of 56 years and do not develop asthma. However, some children may continue to have such episodes and they can develop future asthma. Such children usually have family members with allergies, are exposed to environmental pollutantssmoking, etc. 5.

Along with this, I am currently taking medication for blood pressure and diabetes. Kindly provide your insight.", "output": "I have carefully reviewed the reports you provided attachments removed to protect the patients identity. In cases of diabetes, kidney dysfunction can occur when diabetes and blood pressure are not well controlled. I noticed that your glomerular filtration rate GFR was around 90 in five years ago, and it has declined to 42 over the past seven years. Given your metabolic issues, there is a higher likelihood of diabetic nephropathy. However, I suggest you to get the other potential causes of kidney dysfunction ruled out. Could you please share the names of the medications you are currently taking? Additionally, I would like to know your urine protein creatinine ratio, as well as your average blood pressure, which could potentially be high most of the time. Are you using any alternative medications? I would also like to know your cholesterol level, history of recurrent urine infections, and whether you have undergone an ultrasound of the kidneys. These factors can also contribute to kidney dysfunction. Regarding your current creatinine level, it falls under mild kidney dysfunction. However, I suggest you undergo investigation for the cause of the sudden rise in creatinine within a few months. I hope this has helped you. Kindly follow up if you have more doubts."}

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

I had been to all the doctors with all different opions but with no better result. I will discuss the issue ina bit details. couple years back i decided to have a baby so me and amy wife started this natural phenomenon of conciving a natural baby. However to our surprise we werent able to do so we decided to consult a gynec and he suggest for detailed siemen analysis. The report was low sperm count at that time 20 Millions .Gynec said we can go ahead and give it a try naturally but obviously we didnt succeed. We were asked to check my PH ,FSH, TH and Testotorne soon after that. The PH and FSH level was very high so my gynec suggested me to go for an MRI. Soon after the MRI i was diagnosed with a micro adenoma which in medical terminology is a Pitutary tumor. I was directed to a endocrinologist and he advised me to have Cabergoline. I was on Cabergoline for almost a year and a half and i had couple if blood test which revelad a PH of 0.6 to 0.6 and FSH was max till 11. I did a siemen anaysis in between as well and it went till 11 millions.i went an urologist as well and and a 3 doppler test done which revealed an 3 mm vericosile. Now my query is i had stopped Cabergoline for almost 3 months and did an siemen anaysis which revealed an count of 6 million. (just to mention my siemen volume also keeps on flactuatin from 0.8 ml to 2.00 ml 1- Does FSH and PH affects fertility. 2- if yes what is the best medicine for it. 3- i had been on Fertil M medication which has shown significant improvement. Any suggestion on this. 4-does Vericocile affects fertility. If yes what is the medical treatment. Lastly i am now very confused and dont know the future course of action and line of treatment. Can anyone suggest me a way out of this confusion please.", "output": "I understand your confusion regarding the endocrine orchestra. Duration of your married lifeB. How long have you been tryingC. Your job natureD. Your thyroid hormone, testosterone levels.Coming to your questions, I can suggest you these things based on the available information.1. Prolactin is an important hormone that affects fertility and fortunately this cause is easily correctable by drugs which can normalise sperm count and motility. An increase in prolactin causes decrease in sperm count, motility and quality. It reduces testosterone male hormone levels as well. I see that your prolactin has been adequately treated and you have stopped it three months ago. But your sperm count is at 6 million recently which is low and cannot be reasoned accurately without evaluating in depth. Unfortunately, male factors like oligospermia low sperm count are difficult to treat and intrauterine insemination iui where good quality sperms are separated in adequate numbers and are injected directly into the uterus, is tried as treatment method to aid conception.2. Your FSH is at the higher end of normal range and difficult to remark as I dont have your testosterone levels available. It varies in response to other hormonal levels like prolactin and testosterone.3.Fertyl M works by increasing FSH which augments sperm count. As your FSH is normal, its unlikely to help you significantly.4. Your varicocele is currently mild and doesnt require a surgery. Wearing cotton and comfortable undergarments, quitting alcohol and smoking if you are used to, helps. Nothing needs to be done for varicocele as of now. Vitamin A, E and C supplements enhance sperm qualby working as antioxidants.5. To know the best line of action your partner needs to get few tests to know if she s ovulating and if her fallopian tubes hysterosalpingogram are good. If yes, you can try iui for 4 to 6 cycles provided your processed semen count is preferably 5 million.Hope you have been answered satisfactorily. Good luck."}

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

Secondly, even though a small amount of sperm can be present in preejaculate, it typically only starts to leak out very close to the time of orgasm. So if your partner was not close to orgasm when he pulled out, the chances of being exposed to viable sperm is also extremely low.So in summary, in your particular scenario, your chances of pregnancy are extremely low. Nothing except abstinence is 100 effective, however in your case, I think you can be reassured that you will not conceive.For some additional information, I just wanted to let you know the typically women have some vaginal bleeding or spotting between 3 to 7 days after taking Plan B. This is normal and is actually a sign that the pill is working. Your real menstrual cycle may be delayed if you have any bleeding from the Plan B.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. Let me know if I can assist you further.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"}

Three stents inserted with one failure and replaced. He is a white 50 year old. High blood pressure. Also, needs knee joint replacement, but they keep discouraging him from having the surgery. He keeps telling me he is not going to live long and I need to be prepared for this. His heart surgery was in 2007. Please give me an average life expectancy of people who have been through what he has. It s uncomfortable talking to him about it. I m going to be married to him soon, I need answers. Thank you Kelli", "output": "Hi, Kelli. That is a difficult and complicated question to answer. He has severe premature coronary artery disease. There are 2 important pieces of information I would want in order to help answer your questionthe most important is What is his Ejection Fraction EF? That is the muscle strength number of his heart. Has he just had blocked arteries treated with surgery and stents? Or has he had heart attack damage to his heart muscle? It is the latter, not the former, that greatly reduces a persons life expectancy. The 2nd question is At what age did his parents die? Cardiac disease and cardiac mortality seems to be hereditary, although there are many factors involved, and many more treatment advances in medicines, cardiac interventions, and cardiac surgeries between his generation and his parents generation that have improved survival for this generation vs. previous ones.One study from the Mayo clinic showed that in patients with 3vessel cardiac disease blockages in all 3 major coronary arteries and a normal EF normal is usually considered between 6075, the 5year survival rate was about 90. With 3 vessel disease and an EF between 3550, it was about 70. With 3vessel disease and an EF under 35, it drops to about 50.Of course, much depends on luck and medical care. Does he see his doctors regularly? Is he on standardofcare medications that are proven to help reduce future cardiac events andor decrease his mortality rate? These include beta blockers, statins, ACE Inhibitors especially if hes diabetic or has had heart attacks or reduced EF, aspirin, maybe other antiplatelet drugs. Has he stopped smoking or even better, never smoked? Does he have diabetes diabetics have higher death and complication rates in general and for many specific complications? Is it wellcontrolled if he does? Does he have a defibrillator AICD if his EF is at or below 30?As much as we know about mortality risks from chronic ischemic heart disease and chronic left ventricular dysfunction, there is much we dont understand. Two people can have the same combination of diseases, the same cardiac history, the same heart surgeries, the same EFsand one can have severe symptoms while the other is wellcompensated and has no symptoms and a much better quality of life. Even with those survival percentage graphs, we may know a percentage number, but we never know for sure who will wind up in which percentage group. All we can do is make sure the people take care of themselves, exercise regularly under the supervision of their doctor, lose weight, refrain from smoking, take the correct combination of mortalityimproving medications regularly, and give themselves the best chance of doing well and surviving. The rest is up to Gd or fate or whatever.Congratulations, Kelli, on your engagement, and good luck to you and your fiancee. While these conversations are always uncomfortable, they are important, and, since you will soon be graduating from his fiancee to his wife, you have every right to open a conversation with him about it. Chances are, if he loves you enough to warn you as he did, hed love you enough to be honest about sharing with you what his doctors have told him. You could also ask him if hed mind if you accompany him to his next doctors visit. I have plenty of patients who bring their fiancees or spouses with them. As a matter of fact, I find out most of my honest information from my male patients wives"}

It occurs at night and is a debilitating pain right under the bust area, almost like a knife being poked out from under the skin. When this happens, breathing is difficult, lying down is utterly painful, the only position confortable is sitting cross legged on grond and having my head tilted forward, arms below head, to relieve the pain from the spasms. They occur mainly at night and the pain continues throughout night, and is debilitating. It may be connected to stress but am unsure. I am desperate to find a cure or way to stop these diaghram spasma, is there a specialist i should visit? I live in Pasadena, CA. Thnak you. Isabelle", "output": "Diaphragm spasms are usually more like hiccups, although bad hiccups can also be quite painful. It sounds like you are having esophageal spasms, which can be very painful. Either way, you need to be evaluated for both as treatment may vary. You might also have reflux esophagitis which can be related to aspiration of stomach acid. This can cause laryngeal spasm which can also result in shortness of breath and pain. Your best option is to start with a gastroenterologist GI specialist. They can do an endoscopy to take a direct look into your esophagus or other tests to check the pressures and see there are muscle spasms or inflammation. Stress could certainly aggravate these conditions, but it would be important to know exactly what is causing them so that the correct treatment is started. Hope this helps."}

An important note to remember is that if you forgot to take it less than 12 hrs late, taking it as soon as you remember and taking the next one at its usual time will still protect you from pregnancy. If you are more than 12 hrs late and missed one pill only, same rules apply but if you missed more than 2 pills, continue taking them as usual and use an extra method like as you mentioned using condoms for next 7 days. You said you were able to take the pill on Saturday morning which is good. Continue taking the pill as it is. If you are not confident, there is no harm in using an extra method. There is no need to take a morning after pill as you did not have sex the night you did not take the pill. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important. In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support.If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min,buccal or intranasal midazolam may be used and is often preferred by parents.If the parents are very anxious concerning their childs seizures, intermittent oral diazepam 0.33 mgkg every 8 hr during fever or intermittent rectal diazepam 0.5 mgkg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr, can be given during febrile illnesses.Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of recurrence of febrile seizures.Regards  Dr. Sumanth"}

I have gone through your history, and it is a bit unusual for a 40yearold to have polyarticular gout, that is involving a lot of joints. Firstly, I would recommend you visit a Rheumatologist near you to sort it out. Meanwhile, first, we should rule out if it is gout only or some other form of arthritis, which are intermittent sorts like gout such as Palindromic Rheumatism. I would like to know your last uric acid levels and if you have ever got rheumatoid factor RF and AntiCCP anticyclic citrullinated peptide done. If it is gout, then Indomethacin is just going to help the attack. You need to start on proper medications. The treatment would be to start tablet Zycolchine Colchicine along with drugs like Febuxostat or Allopurinol. 1. 24hour urine for uric acid. 2. Rheumatoid Factor. 3. AntiCCP antibody. 4. Liver function tests. 5. Kidney function tests. Palindromic Rheumatism. Zycolchine. High fluid intake. Consult a Rheumatologist at the earliest."}

These can be used alone or in combination as per the skins requirement. in your case, you may begin with these Use a good sunscreen daily Taking vitamin c and antioxidant supplements would be beneficial. Vitamin c helps in collagen synthesis and antioxidants prevents free radical damage Use a good moisturiser suitable to your skin type to keep your skin well hydrated. There is no harm in using tretinoin vitamin A derivative. Tretinoin induces collagen production and helps in shedding of dead layers of skin thus helping in reducing fine lines. However it may irritate your skin. Use it in small quantities in night and do not rub it over face. Use of sunscreen in morning is mandatory with retinoids as it makes skin sensitive to sun. Initially in the beginning use it for two hours and as the skin sensitivity decreases you may apply it overnight. As you are still 29, you may also use a night cream with vitamin A,C,E to prevent ageing. The chances of irritation with such creams would be less as compared to tretinoin. Hope that answers your query. Take care."}

Therefore, I believe you should do what you can to control the SVTs. Perhaps, this medication is causing intolerable side effects so you need to have a discussion with your doctor to see if another suitable drug can be chosen. Often times that solves a lot of problems. Second, I would check your orthostatic blood pressures your doctor knows about this and make sure any other medications youre taking are not potentially lowering blood pressure, you need to be well hydrated at all times, and not becoming hypoglycemic i.e. skipping meals for weight loss purposes, etc.. Beyond that, if there are still problems your doctor may consider an ultrasound of the carotid arteries and do other blood work to guarantee there are no blockages in the arteries going to the brain and that you dont have an anemia that should be treated especially since these feelings have now occurred during exertional activities. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"}

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

You need to specify why it was done and what your symptoms are. The test indicates macrocytosis larger platelet than usual, red cell distribution width is higher than normal 11.5 to 14.5. This indicates that your bone marrow which produces all the blood cells such as red blood cells, platelets and granulocyte white blood cells neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocyte is not getting enough vitamin B 12 cyanocobalamin and folic acid. I do not know are you anemic since there is no indication of red blood cell count there. The cause can be from not getting enough folic acid and vitamin B 12 in your diet, or your intestine does not absorb enough B 12 vitamin, a condition called pernicious anemia from lack of intrinsic factor needed for their absorption. You may be a vegetarian because if you eat enough meat, you would not be having folate and B 12 deficiency.You may have vitamin B12 and folic acid tablets."}

{"context": "Are temporary fillings safe for children?", "input": "I brought my 8-year-old son to the dentist because he broke his front tooth (two-thirds of a tooth is gone, and one-third of a tooth with the root is still there). We went to a clinic. The first dentist came, and he said this required root canal treatment so that he would refer us to another dentist. He said the pulp is exposed, so he would do some treatment first to prevent it from getting worse. It looks like he was using something (which I do not know what it is) to fill my son's broken tooth. But in the middle of the treatment, my son cried a lot, and the dentist needed to stop the treatment. So the treatment is stopped in the middle. We left the clinic for a walk to calm my son down. An hour later, we came back to the clinic to continue the treatment. The first dentist who treated my son was not there. The second dentist came. He said it was hard to fill the hole, so he said he would use clay to fill the hole temporarily. The second treatment is done. So now his tooth is covered by something that looks like clay.", "output": "They would not have intentionally left anything inside the childs tooth if they stopped the treatment in the middle. But the second dentist has just filled the tooth with a temporary filling material which means the treatment is incomplete and your child still is prone to infection. So what I would suggest is that whichever dentist you are visiting next, please get an Xray IOPA  intraoral periapical xray done for that tooth. So the dentist will also get an idea of what to do next. Because you said it is the front tooth, and it is likely to be a permanent central incisor, not a primary tooth. So definitely requires a root canal treatment and capping if needed or bulk filling after root canal treatment. The treatment is incomplete, so do not worry about the material used because usually, it is unethical to leave any foreign object like a file inside it might be just the temporary filling they did. So no immediate threat, but because the childs fractured tooth is left incomplete, better to save that tooth by getting an IOPA IOPA  intraoral periapical Xray done at your nearest dentist and then the root canal treatment. If you have further queries, I will gladly answer."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

Some of these conditions can be treated if known. Pain can also be due to stomach infection or in relation to disease in organs like kidneys, live, spleen. Therefore it is important to give her higher dose of pain reliever and also treat any condition other than the cancer that is causing pain.In my opinion, it is best to do an ultrasound scan and know if the cause of pain is treatable and give medication for that.Pain and life expectancy are not comparable.

The dentist has said otherwise teeth and gums are healthy but offered no suggestions as to how this can be rectified - as it is affecting my son's confidence....  thanks", "output": "Fluorosis is a common cause for this condition. The pulp chamber of the teeth may decrease in size with age and affect the color of the overall tooth. Some severe cases of mottling are at higher risk of decay. Cosmetic concerns can be very personal and todays procedures offer many options.Whitening or bleaching procedures can make the spots appear more blended. There is no guarantee on the amount of change, but if result may be satisfactory. This procedure can be repeated and does not prevent trying any other procedure. Whitening toothpaste can be a first step and helps to maintain the shade. There are take home methods and in office treatments available. Your son, being young, would need to be evaluated by the dentist. Age, large nerve chambers pulp, and sensitivity are concerns. This is best for mild case and can be repeated.Micro and Macro Abrasion removes a layer of enamel. The teeth are polished. This procedure can not be reversed and is best for mild to moderate conditions. This does not need to be repeated.Bonding or veneering teeth is a procedure where a composite material that matches or is lighter than the natural tooth shade is layerd on top of the tooth. This can be a thin, additional layer covering the entire tooth, which would be reversible by a dentist or may include some removal or reshaping of enamel which would make it not reversible. Fracture is a risk or wear can occur requiring replacement. This is best for moderate to severe cases.Porcelain veeners are a stronger, more color stable material that cover teeth and can provide multiple shade selections. Thin to thicker veneers are possible with varing amounts of enamel alteration performed. This is the most expensive option. Veneers may fracture or need replacement. This can be best for severe and weakened enamel.I hope this offers you a solution for your son and you find my suggestions helpful. Please do not hesitate to ask additional questions."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

It has been used for premenstrual syndrome, patients need folate, teenagers above 15 years of age with acne, etc. It is up to you either you want to continue with Yasmin or Elvina. But consider one point regarding contraceptives that it is better to avoid similar contraceptive for a long time to reduce side effects like short term and long term like mood variations, cycles irregularity, headache, high blood pressure, stroke, clot formation, endometrial hyperplasia, and breast cancer, etc. The side effects differ in each individual.

He rubbed any precum off before he inserted it and was inside for 10-20 seconds and then pulled it out. He did not ejaculate in me. My period is delayed. I am not experiencing any other symptoms besides PMS. Should I be worried?", "output": "The chances of getting pregnant with the scenario you described are next to minimal. Precum does not cause pregnancy easily as it is very low in sperm quantity. Also, your partner was inside only for 1020 seconds and did not ejaculate inside you, making you getting pregnant even less likely. So I suggest you get it evaluated. You will need a few tests and medicines for missed or delayed periods like thyroid function tests, prolactin, ultrasound abdomen to rule out PCOD polycystic ovarian disease. Once the correct diagnosis is established and the proper treatment is started, you will be fine within two weeks. All I conclude is that your missed or delayed periods are not due to pregnancy but some medical reasons. Hope this helps. Kindly revert in case of further queries."}

There is no itching or pain. But I noticed sensitivity and tingling in the same leg. Can this be a shingle lesion following a COVID-19 infection?

If the lesion is persistent for four weeks without any symptoms, raised lesions, or vesicles, then it is unlikely to be herpes simplex or shingles. Instead, it might be due to a fungal infection or eczematous type lesion. I would suggest consulting a doctor in person for a physical examination. You can get back with details like distribution, symptoms, other diseases, or medications. Include information about treatments you took, lesion evolution, contact history, and partner history.

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

{"context": "My HIV duo test was negative on 20th day after exposure. Am I safe?", "input": "I had an exposure two months back. I received a blow job from a sex worker. The activity I indulged in was blowjob and kiss, no penetrative sex was done, and I did not give her oral either. I was so tensed that on the 20th day of exposure, I had HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) 2 plus p24 antigen tests which came negative with an index value (.1) and index value greater than one are positive according to the report. I am so depressed and will go for testing after three months. Is my exposure high risk? Which test should I do now? And what are my chances for other STDs(Sexually Transmitted Disease)?", "output": "First, I need to inform you that, the oral cavity has the lowest viral load and the possibility of transmission is least to none. Secondly, the HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus virus has an envelope that is made of fats which will be digested by salivary enzymes. So, HIV survival is least in saliva. But, only indication to count is injury or ulcer in the oral cavity. Thirdly, coming to your scenario, oral sex cannot transmit the infection even if she had HIV infection considering she had no oral ulcers and you had no ulcer on the penis. You are not at risk of acquiring HIV. HIV has a window period of 45 days to three months. So get western blot test after 45 days to completely rule out HIV infection. Coming to STD, yes, you may get and chances are high. The infection can be HPV human papillomavirus, HSV herpes simplex virus. No need to have any measures at this stage."}

These drugs cause automatic relaxation and ur breathing gets normal. The other symptoms of anxiety include restlessness, sweating, rapid and shallow breathing, increased heart rate, confusion, disturbed bowels and increased frequency of urination.

With Productive M, testosterone is production is stimulated which is known from several studies to lower blood sugar significantly.If you were my patient, I would advise you to follow your therapeutic guidelines for blood sugar control 1. Carbohydrate counting do you know how much you need? 2. Avoid sugar and high glycemic carbohydrates 2. Add omega3 supplements and fatty fish to your diet 3. Gradually increase your fiber intake focusing on soluble fiber to at least 14 g per 1000 calories if overweight, lose weight 4. Exercise more than 150 minutes per week 5. Avoid all sugar substitutes stevia may be ok 6. Use more cinnamon in seasoning a mediterrean style eating pattern is often recommended.These are just general guidelines for controlling sugar. If you were my patient I would suggest you entertain the thought of diabetic core classes or at least an individualized visit with a dietitian to get nutritional guidance.Good luck.

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

For example, fear one type of anxiety, called situational anxiety is almost always accompanied with a significant increase in heart rate, paleness, heavy breathing all symptoms of adrenalin flush in the system. My opinion is that, just to exclude the heart origin of this sign with highest probability, you should be put on a 24hour Holter rhythm monitor. Otherwise, my opinion is that this is only benign and not to worry about. Although, if this situation affects your quality of life and everyday duties, I recommend a consult with a psychanalist or psychiatrist, to further determine this condition and to start or withhold treatment. I hope I was helpful with my answer.Best regards."}

Sore throat in most cases is of viral origin and if you had a strep throat recently is less likely you have another strep throat but it is not impossible. To make sure you need to have a rapid test for strep throat and if it is negative you have a viral throat infection and is self limiting and no need for Antibiotics.

Doctor has prescribed few medicines Clamp (salt amoxicillin etc) , T-minic & Tixylix (we were giving him before) and nasal drops Nasikind-P. But after starting the medicines his condition is getting worst. He is not taking feed and throwing out whatever he is taking. His nose is still blocked and running as well, now he is not having feed, not taking proper feed because his nose is fully blocked.

{"context": "Why did the doctor advise to stop breast milk and start Isomil formula for my baby?", "input": "My baby is 3 months old, last month he had rashes and a loose motion, we did a stool test of ph and reducing substance done, the report says that the reducing substance is positive, the doc advices to stop mothers milk and start isomil formula, the baby did not take isomil, so I continued with breastfeeding and after some days we checked his weight, it was good, the baby is growing properly, he is active, does not cry coz of colic. He poops 6 to 7 times max, he is exclusive breastfeed, he frequently passes urine. The only thing is poop is bit greenish but the test report say it's yellowish brown, other than that there is no issues of rashes also everything is fine, baby sleeps well and passes the gasses well.. The stool test was done again yesterday and it's the same as last test ie reducing substance is positive My queries are as below 1 from above description shall we still follow doc by stopping breastfeeding and using isomil Why has this issue come up in 2 months, before it was all good.  How long will this intolerance last I have stopped dairy products, I can't have a small cup of tea also, can I have it? Can I use half cup milk for tea?", "output": "Hi, Am glad to hear you did not stop breastfeeding and that the babys weight gain is good. Babies of 3 months may pass stools after every feedwhich means if you feed 10 times, they may pass stools 10 times. So that is not a thing to get worried. Regarding the colour of the stools, greenyellowgoldenbrown are all normal shades of stools. So you dont have to worry about green colour. Please remember one more important thing  if the baby is not having any problemssymptoms, then, dont get any tests done. Because even in a completely normal person there can be a few parameters outside the normal range. We cannot keep chasing the lab report completely forgetting the babys condition. If you get a routine health check done during your visit to your pediatrician for vaccination it is sufficient That is, if the baby is not having any problemssymptoms. Any change in the mothers diet changes the composition of the breast milk to a small degree, which then is reflected on the childs routine. You may start taking milk with tea, initially small amounts and gradually increase. The babys bowel movement pattern might change but that doesnt mean it is not good for babys health. But dont start to feed cows milkpateurised milk to the baby yet. Let the baby be atleast 67 months for that. Please let me know if you have any questions."}
