{"context": "What can cause palpitations and bad headaches?", "input": "I am a 75 years old man in excellent health, physically active( swimming, windsurfing, jogging ). I have been taking medication for a few years for marginal high blood pressure and cholesterol. My pressure is usually 125/75. The last exam I had ( blood test, heart condition, etc gave me a very clean bill of health) Today I was planning to go swimming at the pool for lapses, as usual, and I took an unusually substantial lunch with fried eggs and a glass of wine ,after which went for an equally afternoon nap (the wine had somehow ..knocked me off.) I was deeply asleep when I was abruptly awaken by my wife yelling something I couldn\u2019t understand at first. It turned out she had left the stove open and the rice was burning. I got so startled for this sudden wake-up , even before knowing what it was, that my heart started racing and I felt something unusually wrong in my body. A sense of heaviness, the heart not only racing, but pounding.. I immediately took my blood pressure and I got even more startled: the first reading was a whopping 170/125. Never ever happened before! The second reading, a few minutes after was better : 145/119. Not bad for the systolic pressure, but still unusually high, especially for the diastolic reading. As a precaution, I took a 2nd blood pressure pill ( I usually take one a day) and a hot bath, after which the readings went back to normal: 120/70. I am planning to see my doctor again soon, , but in the meantime I would like to know if this sudden blood pressure hyke can be explained by the sudden wake-up, the heavy meal and the fact that the nap was in the mid-afternoon, maybe for reasons having to do with a perturbated circadian rhythm. When I nap I usually do it at around 1 p.m and I seem to recall to have had the same symptoms, but much milder after sleeping later on in the afternoon. Thanks for your comments Ittiandro", "output": "Blood pressure generally tends to rise after meals. The palpitations must have been caused because of sudden disturbance in sleep.

Prolactin: 5.6 ng/mL. Progesterone: 1.5 ng/mL. Testosterone: 0.2ng/mL. My menstrual cycle is of about 31-32 days and last time I had periods within 28 days. I am using Clomid and Ovafin from the last three months in two to seven days of menstruation, but I have not conceived yet. Along, with infertility, I am suffering from vaginal farts, weight increase, facial acne, mood swings, and headache. I am very stressed. Please guide me and tell me the reason for infertility.", "output": "Hi. All of your test reports are normal. You are trying for pregnancy just from last seven to eight months. Kindly give yourself some time and you can get pregnant naturally. As your periods are regular, in my opinion, you do not need ovulation induction medicines like Clomid. In fact, you do not need any medicine right now. Just continue Folic acid tablets and continue trying naturally, you should get pregnant naturally. If there was any infection after last D  C dilation and curettage, you can get your tubes checked by HSG hysterosalpingography to be sure that everything is normal. You can do that test after trying naturally without medicines for three months. I hope this helps."}

After 24 hours of antibiotics the swelling went down and now he has a flabby area under his chin, above his adams apple, that looks like a sack that just flops around.

It is just more of an odd feeling in my head. I don t fall and I m not unstable at all. No headachs or other pains. The lightheadedness is very light but notacable for sure", "output": "Hi, Why suggest a medication as opposed to looking for the UNDERLYING CAUSE? Theres virtually nothing more vague to assess and treat than the symptom of lightheadedness which is even sometimes hard to pin down from patient to patient as to what they exactly MEAN? Make sense? If this is something thats recently started then, check out any new medications you may be on...especially antidepressants, heart drugs, and blood pressure drugs. If any of those types of medications are recently prescribed since this symptom started then, there may be something there to go to your doctor about. If not, how about changes to your diet or hydration habits? If youre skipping meals, going on crash diets, or not drinking enough WATER WATER WATER....then, these symptoms may be present as well. Could you be having OCULAR problems, in need of a change of eyeglass prescription, or just in need in eyeglasses? Are you looking at a computer screen for too long per day...or at a time? Then, there is always the wildcard of stress, anxiety, depressive mood disorders that could sometimes kick in without realizing. Have there been recent changes in life events, financial status, job, or romance status? Could these be impacting how you are feeling? So as you can see, the cause of your symptoms can be so wildly varied that the likelihood of finding or being prescribed a Single medication for your 1020 episodes of this symptom is extremely small.

I have tried a retinoid, Doxycycline, countless topical creams and scrubs, a six-month course of Accutane, and nothing seemed to work permanently. Accutane was the most effective drug at preventing my acne but, two months after I stopped it, my acne came back, not as severe, though. I believe that signifies the acne I suffer from is hormonal, so I just have to wait until the testosterone I produce stops affecting my sebaceous glands drastically. But I wanted to know if there is anything else I have not tried because my face looks horrible, and I have severe hyperpigmentation from the past pimples.

More information about my skin is that I am white, light-skinned, and about 150 lbs.", "output": "It seems like you have had really bad acne and have been trying hard to improve it. I would suggest you not to stop the treatment abruptly as it usually leads to a flare. Instead, once the acne is controlled, you should reduce the frequency to a maintenance dose, such as weekly once or twice, for a longerterm. Salicylic acid peels do work well for acne and oily skin when applied correctly. You may need four to six sessions, with monthly one session frequency. Chemical peels even help to lighten your postacne pigmentation. Do not prick your acne as it leads to infection, scarring, and pigmentation."}

My grandmother gave me a peppermint and as I swallowed it felt as if a piece got stuck in my throat. I got a strong sensation that I could not breathe. When I reached my sister's home, I took a walk outside and within 10 minutes the sensation went away. I had this issue on and off for the next couple of years, yet it was manageable. Fast forwarding to this year, the symptoms have worsened. I have severe shortness of breath all day long with no relief, sharp pain on the left side of the chest, arm and sometimes jaw pain, headaches, lightheadedness, weakness, insomnia, out of touch with reality and nervousness. I feel like I am going to die at any minute. In the last two months, I have been to the ER about six times. Whenever I go, the doctor will say it as GERD and panic attacks. Once, I visited a hospital for chest pain and they admitted me for observation as one of my enzyme tests came back minimally high. The doctor stated that she wanted to keep me on observation, because of my family history of heart disease and I am a smoker. All my tests were normal, but my symptoms are still present. My PCP prescribed me 5 mg Buspar twice daily and Zoloft 100 mg once daily. I have been on these for a month with absolutely no results. He set me up in order to see a pulmonary physician; however, stated that it was extremely unlikely that I had any breathing restrictions due to the several tests I have had. Also, stated that he was fairly confident that my heart was fine. I have lost count of the EKGs, ECGs, CT scans, chest x-rays, and blood work, which is all negative. He did mention that my physical symptoms could potentially be coming from sleep apnea. I know that I have caused some of this on myself, because I am obese and I do smoke. I have no quality of life and at this point I am beginning to feel depressed. I barely can get through a shift at work. When I stay at home, I am afraid to be alone. Also, driving is a nightmare.

To begin, quit smoking immediately and adopt a healthy diet while focusing on weight loss. Start with a 10minute physical exercise routine and gradually increase its intensity, such as simple walking. By following these steps, sleep apnea may eventually subside. Consider having a stress ECG to identify any heart vessel spasms during exertion. If your condition doesnt improve, consult a psychiatrist to alleviate your anxiety."}

I am 21 years old living with my very conservative religious immigrant parents and I do not know if I should take the second pregnancy test seriously.

However, get a serum beta HCG human chorionic gonadotropin blood test to rule out pregnancy, as PT has some chances of false positivity and false negativity as it is weakly positive.

Some more serious issues such as tumors and carcinomas are less common but should be considered if there is pain and rapid growth of it.

{"context": "How will a child with autism behave?", "input": "Hi doctor, I have just noticed recently my 15 months old when he plays with his electronic toys that light up. He will look closely at where they light up and open his mouth like a stun. It does not happen all the time though. I know this is a sign of autism. But he has great eye contact, responds to name, asks for help with something, babbling, says words like nah, dada, nana for banana, he will point to banana in the book and say it. That to me is pretty smart for a 15-month-old. Imitates, for example, claps hands understands when I say something like, hey Siri he looks straight at the phone. Waves bye we do not even face to say goodbye just I am going or when dad leaves for work and he waves. Loves cuddles sometimes he will gnaw in my arms and make noises. Do not know if that is just a soothing thing he does. We went to playgroup yesterday and looked at what others were doing smiling and laughing. Walked by 14 months. Follows others if they go somewhere, he will open his books and sound out what they are and looks at me as he does it. I know these all sound like a normal developed child, but I am just worried he will not outgrow what he is doing and later develop it. Am I worrying for nothing I just wanted to get your thoughts.", "output": "Hi. Please note that whatever you have described is a sign of a normal growing child. It is not a sign of autism. These are signs of the child grasping the knowledge of the things and interacting with things around him. Please do not worry. Also, I would advise tender loving care to your child. Spend more time with the child and interact more often with him. Your child should be fine if your interaction with him is fine. Find ageappropriate toys and games for him. It will improve his intellect. One thing I would advise is to prevent giving your phone or for that matter any phone to the growing child. Handing over a mobile phone to any child cancels all human interaction. The child could have as the child would be lost in the neverending world of the cell phone and not even realize it. I hope I have answered your question and helped you gain an insight into how you can look after the psychological and intellectual growth of your child."}

I went in with no sign of cold or cough, however, subsequent to waking up, I keep on having tingling feeling only on my right nostril , as if I have an allergy or cold. I have been sneezing and blowing my nose. Discharge is clear and watery. Can Propofol cause it, or can I get infected by the breathing tube, since it only happens on one nostril? Thank you.", "output": "Sneezing as a side effect becomes significant only if propofol was injected near the eye periocular injections along with sedation, otherwise not directly related. There are other possibilities though such as allergy to propofol but there would have been other symptoms when the injection was given like feeling hot and itchy throughout, loss in blood pressure etc that you did not have and allergy to latex that you would have had significant exposure to during this procedure. If latex allergy is likely, you can get a blood test for specific IgE to latex, or a skin test followed by glove challenge if indicated. I would be glad to answer subsequent queries if you have any.

Not after the surgery I regularly go for a walk of 4 kms in the morning, take my medicines regularly, follow balanced diet but miss sometimes :). I have quit smoking but I use to take onle beer around 650ml that is too alternate day. I want to know that how many years I can live with the same life style. Is it true that CABG can give around 10 years of life span and after that the problem reoccur??", "output": "That is true. About reoccurrence nothing could be told, but it is true that there are certain probabilities for bypasses to close. The probability for a saphenous vein graft, used for bypass, to be found close is 50 after ten years. Whereas, for the arterial grafts left or right internal mammary arteries is around 815, depending on various studies. Anyway, I do not think that these figures should worry you. The most important thing is that the surgery went well and you can live a normal and healthy life now. Even if the reoccurrence happens, there are other alternatives to treat the coronary arteries, such as stent implantation into a certain native coronary artery, bypass of which can be found narrowed or closed. As long as you are free of symptoms, there is nothing to worry about, however 6monthly controls should be done. There are heralding symptoms, such as angina or shortness of breath, that speak for a narrowing or a new blockage within a graft vessel. In that case, coronary angiogram to control the native arteries and the patency of the grafts should be performed, and a strategy for treating new eventual blockages should be constructed. I hope this is helpful. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"}

Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system most commonly seen in diabetic patients. Another possibility could be nerve compression in spine due to disc bulge.Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate the condition. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calciumrich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetablesVitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness.

{"context": "", "input": "Hello doc. My mother has been diagnosed with right hemiparesis due to clot in the brain. It has been a month now. She is showing little improvement with physical therapy . My only question to you is that her affected right leg sometimes moves on its own, will turn in, or widen out. Is this normal ? Why does this happen ?", "output": "brain stroke is a major cause of disability. however, your mother would show gradual improvement in her weakness over time, with good physiotherapy. spontaneous movements of the paralyzed side can occur due to what is called reflex movements. sometimes, tone in the affected limb can increase, which can cause flexor spasms. both these situations are normal and there is no need to worry. in rare cases, there could be focal fits in the affected side, where there would be jerky movements. this condition requires medications. please talk to her neurologist, who would be able to sort this out."}

My brother is a family physician and either he doesn't believe my mom or he just doesn't know what is causing this. She has also seen a gastroenterologist and her colonoscopy found slight diverticulitis and 2 non cancerous polyps that were removed and no problems found with the endoscopy other than she had a slight inflammation at the top of her stomach that the physician didn't seem too worried about. This is her symptoms... She complains of a severe tightness around her rib cage to the point where she has to take off her bra and has trouble breathing. She also gets bloated sometimes when this happens. I can't stand to see her in pain like this anymore. I did a search on the Internet, (yes, I know you guys hate armchair doctors.. Lol) and it seems a lot of people complain about this but have no answers. A bit on her background- she is 80 years old. She's a diabetic. We thought the metforman was causing the pain so they put her on lantus and humalog. I know diabetes can cause peripheral nerve damage, not sure if that can cause the tightening. She also has had her left kidney removed because the artery that carried the blood to it got clogged and it failed, so they removed it 12 years ago. She also had two stints put in her left and right illiacs to open them as well. She recently had an MRA, and they found two of the 3 main arteries to the bowels are become blocked, but the physician didn't seem to think this would cause tightening, but chronic diarrhea, which she does not have. This all started after she had the flu last January. She has not visited any foreign country recently, so I don't think it's a parasite. I read that maybe she should have a stool sample to check for parasites. Have you heard of this condition? Any of you? Any suggestions on what to try? I am at my wits end. She lays in her bed and moans when this happens and she's not a complainer so I know it's bad. Thanks for your time.", "output": "It is not explained by any of the problems that you have cited, namely, polyps in the colon, diverticulitis. She has a history of blockage in various arterieskidney, small bowel, iliacs. So she probably has a tendency to excessive clotting. She may have had blockage in one of the arteries supplying the heart and suffered from a mild heart attack. In diabetics, the symptoms of a heart attack are suppressed and atypical.So, i would suggest that you immediately show her to a cardiologist"}

I walk 4 km every day. I am not sedentary. I wish to know that this loss of fat and muscle, is it due to hypothyroidism or Glycomet intake.

As far as target levels are concerned, HbA1c of less than 7 indicates excellent control. So, the target is less than 7. However, since you are elder, slightly higher HbA1c is also acceptable. You may reduce the dose to Glycomet SR 500 mg once a day. Fat loss is due to diabetes itself due to insulin resistance. TSH thyroidstimulating hormone is fine and you should continue the same dose of Thyroxine. Rest, you should continue diet control and exercises."}

You have to visit your nearby dentist if there is bleeding in the hurt area, or there are any teeth broken down, or if any tooth is loosened and wobbles, or if there is a gum tear. Also, you have mentioned that you hit your chin region. This part of the jaw is sensitive to fracture in 8 of the cases. Hence, I advise consulting a nearby dentist to eliminate fractures of the jaw firstly. Meanwhile, apply ice packs on the injured region and wash your mouth with lukewarm saltwater which promotes gum healing. Also, avoid hot and spicy or citrus food. Massage the gums with clean fingers in a circular motion and in case of pain apply ointment Orabase Benzocaine along with massaging."}

{"context": "A stomach growth is causing fluid to accumulate in my mother's stomach. What to do?", "input": "My mom had surgery to remove her fibroid alongside her womb. Later we discovered that she also had gallstones. So another surgery was performed on her to remove her gallbladder. After this, her stomach became so hard and could barely eat anything. After the gallbladder removal, she was told it could have been cancerous, so as of now, she has taken about 10 rounds of chemotherapy. The injectable ones are about six. She also took the pills, which made her palms and other body parts dark, but now they are back to normal. Currently, she is left with her last round of chemotherapy, and it is the injectable one scheduled for next month. After her gallbladder removal due to the swelling and hardening, she could not eat well. We were then referred to a radiologist who said she had some fluid inside her stomach to drain that has taken months. We took a CT scan which showed she had a small growth in her stomach area, but doctors failed to tell us what it is. The doctor then told us it would be best if she undergoes another surgery to remove the growth that is causing the fluid in her stomach. After the surgery, we were told he could not remove it all and that if he does it, my mom will not be able to urinate or excrete unless they give her a tube. He stitched where he cut after the surgery, but fluid keeps coming from it every day, so my mother constantly goes for dressing. Now we have been referred back to the radiologist. I am afraid we do not know what else to do.", "output": "I feel very sorry to hear about your mother. She has been through very tough times. From the description, it seems she has gastric outlet obstruction, in short, called GOO. This is an obstruction to the stomach and does not let food go down beyond the stomach. This can occur in patients with advanced gall bladder cancer. A hard stomach, unable to retain meals, and frequent vomiting is the presentation of GOO. So the options of management are surgical, which has already failed. Another option is endoscopic metallic stent placement in the stomach and first part of the duodenum small bowel. You can discuss this with your doctor there and see if it is a possible option for her. Suppose a stent is impossible because of difficult access to the narrowing or absence of expertise. In that case, a feeding gastrostomy a tube draining stomach into the external environment can be placed with frequent suctioning of the stomach juices and food after she takes the meals.

My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today.Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style Nonalcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH. ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver which shows up as increased echo texture on USG. This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left unchecked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details.Have a great day.Dr Suresh Raghavaiah"}

On August 3rd I had unprotected sex. he didnt finish inside me but we wanted to be sure no babies came from this experience. The next morning (14 hours later) I got plan b and took it immediately. I felt sick throughout the day and then was spotting a lot. About two weeks later on august 17th I got a heavy period that only lasted a couple days. Now its September 15th and I havent had another period? I havent had any morning sickness or bloating or any symptoms of pregnancy but Im worried I missed a period. If I was bleeding heavy two weeks after taking plan b would that be my period? I wouldnt be pregnant right? Im only about 110 pounds and 54 so I know my hormones can act up from plan b but Im just worried something went wrong. What should I do?", "output": "hellothanks for your query. the spotting and sickness was most definitely due to plan b. plan b is notorious for altering the pattern of your normal menstrual cycles. it can advance or postpone your periods by a week or more. hence, the heavy bleeding you experienced could be an early period, brought on by plan b. as you have missed your period now, take a pregnancy test to be sure. have protected sex in the future. all the best."}

{"context": "", "input": "My wife has Polycystic ovary syndrome and has irregular periods since early age (18 years old). She used to get period irregular periods in intervals of 1-3 months. In this regard, we visited Fortis Mumbai and started the treatment there. 1. At Fortis Mumbai, we were suggested to take female contraceptives for 3-6 months with the hope that it might help to regularize periods and try naturally afterwards. We tried for 3 months after that but this did not help as there were muliple follicles and mature follicle/ egg formation. 2. Thereafter, we were suggested to go for Clomid to stimulate ovolution. We tried this method for another 6 months but this did not help inspite of increased dosage. The scans during this time still reflected multiple follicules and no single mature follicle (upto maximum 10 mm size). 3. After that, we shifted to Bangalore with the focus of getting results in this regard and visited Fortis Bangalore . We were suggested to undergo various tests like fallopian tube ( HSG ), tuberculosis, semen analysis etc. All the tests were normal and she confirmed that Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCO ) is the only problem and that we should go for IUI as taking clomid for long duration may have side effects. 4. Since then my wife has undergone 3 IUIs and there has not been any positive results, with no explained reasons for failure. We have been suggested that we should try for 3-6 IUIs before thinking of IVF. During the 3 IUIs, genotropin injections was taken from Day 2 for 7-10 days and .The egg formation has been proper and size of mature follicule at the time time of doing IUI has been 18+mm. All this while, my wife is taking follic acid, metformin and CoQ tablets. However, at this point we thought of seeking your expert opinion since you are an expert in this field. Requests your inputs . what should be our next course of action and please suggest best doctor who is PCO specialist in Bangalore.", "output": "hippos is the most common problem nowadays. the main reason for this is stress, sedentary lifestyle, bad eating habits. weight is the major culprit here. metformin will help here to certain extent but major effort should come from the patient, she should walk for 1hr daily, cut down oily food, sweets,junk food like pizzas, should keep her mind calm for which meditation will help. along with these measures consulting good gynecologist will help you. all the best."}

{"context": "Is salt therapy beneficial for non-specific interstitial pneumonia?", "input": "What is non-specific interstitial pneumonia? Is salt therapy beneficial for non-specific interstitial pneumonia? Please explain.", "output": "NSIP nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is a chronic form of interstitial pneumonia, which cause thickening of the interstitium, an anatomical lung part not seen on xrays. This type of thickening can be due to inflammation, scarring or edema in the lungs. Usually, there are two types of NSIP that is cellular and fibrotic. Fibrotic NSIP is more common and more dangerous than cellular NSIP. The mainstay of treatment is the steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. No other type of therapy has been found effective on a long term basis. As you asked about salt therapy, let me clear you that it is a type of complementary therapy mainly in allergic and obstructive lung diseases. It is not to be used as a solo therapy in any disease. It helps to loosen the mucus and relieve dyspnea in patients with chronic lung diseases. The role is only supportive as it is not scientifically proven standard therapy for interstitial lung diseases. So, I advise you to continue the medicine as advised by your pulmonologist and think of this salt therapy only for symptomatic relief of NSIP symptoms and not as a primary line of treatment. There is no alternative to steroid medicines in the treatment of the NSIP."}

It sounds like you only heard a few words of the doctors description, but not the main points. Obtain a copy of the report, and then we could analyze or translate it for you. Echocardiograms take sonogram pictures of your heart. They look at the chambers and valves and other structures in and near your heart, in a similar way that sonogram pictures are done on pregnant women to look at the structures of the developing fetus. The sound waves also can be used to estimate the pressures in certain parts of your heart. Being told you have pressure in your chest is only part of the story. We all have pressure readings in our chests the question is what is the number of that pressure reading, and is it normal or high or low. Im not sure what the statement bloodalso around my lungs means. Echocardiograms sometimes can also detect abnormal fluid collections around the heart or around the lungs. These are called effusions, but we dont know just from looking at the Echo pictures whether they are composed of blood or water or pus, for instance. So, I think the best thing for you to do is not to worry yet just obtain a copy of the report so your doctor or I or one of us here can interpret it.Blood in my heart chambers means you are alive The 4 heart chambers contain and pump around the blood that keeps us all alive.Thanks for your question.

Please be positive, and you will be fine. You were experiencing palpitations. These showcases as a rapid heartbeat or a racing heart. Often palpitations are not caused by underlying heart diseases.

You will be fine. Do you mean your blood pressure measured 80140 or 14080? Please measure and get back to me. Best regards."}
{"context": "What are the symptoms of heart problems?", "input": "I am 15 and recently have been experiencing a faster heart beat lately.

My stress level is a little high right now because of finals coming up.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. In my opinion, your palpitations are mostly due to high stress level in you. But at your age of 15 years, we should first rule out arrhythmia rhythm disturbances in heart as a cause for your palpitations. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring 24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg. If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart diseases. Control of stress and anxiety are needed in your case. For this better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Dont worry, you will be alright. But first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

There are so many product in market for it but i m scare of all because of there side effects please suggest me a good one product or remidies which hasnt side effects", "output": "Hi,Sorry to hear about your problem. But, you are not alone. Many women have small breasts and they feel stressed about it. After about 1920 years the only way breasts would become larger naturally is during lactation.All the creams and gels and tablets available on the net are not proven effective and have their own side effects and of course the costs involved.The only time tested and proven method to increase breast size is by surgery. Most commonly you can use a silicone implant. We can also use your own fat if you have enough, to inject into the breasts.All these options can be discussed with your local plastic surgeon. The surgery of breast augmentation using silicon implants is pretty straightforward and gives lasting results.All the best Dr.Surindherwww.cosmesisindia.com"}

Also, taking up an xray would have been better to understand more of the joint positioning. Also, how long did you undergo physcial therapy rehabilitation plan? as per my view you should go for longer than expected.Also, indeed you got operated for spine twice, but how much time you performed the physical therapy post surgery?physical therapy is a scientific and secure way to rehabilitate the muscle and movements.also, I will say too look for a physical therapy now as to which he will assist you to further. Meantime you can surely take an appointment with a neurologist, as every experts advice will play a role. May be the use of diagnaotics will come into role as technology has helped alot to rule out human body illness to a greater extent. but hardly we understand the best use of technology used in assessing the human body.okay, your muscle spasm is of what kind? that is important. First you need to reduce the muscle spasm by hot water fermentation and whirlpool therapy. you may have to spend a little time in this process as The muscle relaxation will take some time.I will say that you visit a physical therapist so by which your treatment starts. with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery"}

Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. Glycolic peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etcAlso, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microderamabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results.Also, at home you can try using cream containing kojic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, arbutin etc for several months Melaglow cream for additional benefit and maintenance.Always use broad spectrum sunscreen before going out in sun.Use a plain moisturiser like cetaphil DAM on daily basis for healthy and hydrated skin.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.Hope this will take care of your issue.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"}

However, in your mothers case, you indicated that there is metastasis, I will assume that the metastasis is in the liver most common site, the treatment for advanced cholangiocarcinoma is chemotherapy and biliary drainage if there are sysmptoms of biliary obstructionyellowing of skin, teacolored urine, acholic stools. If I was the treating surgeon, I will request additional tests liver function, tumor markers, complete blood count.Second, lets discussed the ultrasonography result it revealed several cysts. Cysts are commonly noncancerous, they are fluid filled masses, commonly containing bile. The treatment is observation for small cysts, if the size is more than 5cm, the risk of rupture is high, hence, unroofing of cyst is suggested.For now, it is really necessary to know the nature of the disease, since they have very different treatments pathways and course of disease.I hope your mother gets well soon"}

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."}

{"context": "", "input": "Hi, I am pregnant 17wks and almost 35years old. I have not taken my thyroid meds in a year. I have graves disease, treated by radioiodine therapy when I was 21. Three years ago, I started to get full body cataplexy drops, expecially after climbing stairs or elevations. Hospitalizations many times ruled out many cardiac and sleep study concerns. It was found that any slight decrease in my postassium level caused the hospitalizations after comparing notes for every visit. The doctor experimented and left me on IV potassium for a week and my levels would not go past 4.0 to make me hyperkalemic at any point, but did not make me feel better. Once the symptoms stopped, I would get released. Finally, they diagnosed me with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and potassium supplement nor potassium sparing diaretic would suffice. It actually made it worse. Ultimately, after discovering that sipping Pedialyte slowly all through the day kept me out of the emergency room, they put me on time released low dose potassium capsules 4x a day (10meq) as well as noting my thyroid levels had finally thrown me into hypothyroid after all these years since therapy. A year ago my TSH w T4 reflex was 1.80 and today it is 13.6. My potassium levels have been fine and I do take B12 monthly injections since I was 20 for pernicious anemia diagnosed by spinal tap a year before the Graves disease. I will see my endocrinologist this week but I am worried that the OB referred me to a maternal/fetal medicine specialist. They are getting familiar with electrolyte imbalances and taking the proper chromosome testing for my age and I await results. I am concerned about possibly getting paralysis attacks and falling while pregnant. It has not happened since I got pregnant, even though I feel awfull and stay in bed or on the couch. I am assuming the thyroid levels contribute to this worse feeling of my life because of my own neglect. I thought thyroid medicines made my heart race and made me have paralysis attacks more often, so I stopped to prove I dont have them as often when not taking Synthroid or Levothryroxine. The only other abnormality any specialist came up with during hospitalizations was a nuerologist noted strange brain waves during the test they make you hyperventilate to go to sleep (I did not sleep, only paralyzed myself) and he noted a small sclerosis on my hippocampus that was missed from a different hospital. I have not followed up with the nuerologist in fear because he had no answer for what causes it. Is it possible that tweaking my thyroid levels with treatment can cause the electrolyte issues to suddenly reappear and make it unsafe to be unattended or exert myself as before, noted by my frequent hospital visits of the past? My second fear is how much worse can it get until I deliver if I do not treat my thyroid? So in short I ponder: Obey doctor and suffer possible hypokalemic paralysis attacks/cataplexy body drops and treat as they come, or can the consequence of not treating my thyroid be more harmful to myself and the baby? I am not sure how bad a thyroid can get over another 20 weeks to guess which suffering of myself is worse, by for the baby, I am not sure how either symptoms can affect him.", "output": "hi. i can understand the concern you have regarding your baby. the most concerning for me at this point would be the report of a high tsh, since you were off thyroxine supplements, because hypothyroidism during pregnancy is known to affect the fetus and its development including neurological development. so i think a visit to your endocrinologist should be done as soon as possible, and this needs to be corrected. otherwise, you will need to check and monitor your potassium levels and take supplements as required. hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition known to be associated with hyperthyroidism. so take care and get your thyroid status corrected."}

{"context": "What is the reason for chest pain that occurs with deep breath and pressing?", "input": "I need advice and an opinion regarding the chest pain I have been experiencing for the past four days. Around four days ago, while I was cleaning and I was exposed to a lot of dust. After finishing, I coughed and felt like some dust entered my chest. Since then, I have been experiencing chest pain, specifically above my right nipple, which feels like it is in the bone. When I press on my chest bone below or above my right nipple, I feel pain. Sometimes the pain radiates to my neck or side, and today it extended to the left side of my chest, which has me concerned. The pain usually occurs when I take a deep breath but is not constant. Around a month ago, one morning while I was at work on a dusty day, I felt pressure on my chest and had shortness of breath. I went to the emergency room, and they transferred me to the cardiology unit because my troponin levels were elevated. Initially, it was measured at 0.7. They performed an electrocardiogram, which showed normal results. Later that day, my troponin levels increased to 4.3. They conducted an echocardiogram, which also showed normal results. The following day, my troponin levels decreased to 3.4. They suspected a potential blockage and performed my cardiac catheterization, but no blockage was found. The doctor prescribed me three medications Aspirin 81 MG EC tablet for two months, Colchicine 0.6 mg tablet for three weeks, and Omeprazole 20 MG capsule. I do not have diabetes or high blood pressure, and I follow a low-carbohydrate diet with intermittent fasting. My blood pressure and echocardiogram were normal during my hospital stay. However, I was diagnosed with pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the outer layer of the heart. Kindly suggest what should I do?", "output": "Based on the information you provided, there are two possibilities to consider in your case. First is musculoskeletal pain, which originates from the muscles and bones due to coughing and strain on them. The second possibility is a viral infection, which commonly occurs after such exposures. This can lead to inflammation of the pleura and pericardium lining of the lungs, known as pleuritis or pericarditis. Both types of pain can worsen with deep breathing. I guess you do not have any fever, cough, or runny nose, although these symptoms may or may not be present. Did you have a history of heavy weight lifting or chest trauma? It is unlikely that this pain is caused by heart blockages and does not seem worrisome. However, considering your history of pericarditis last month, I suggest you undergo a complete blood count with ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ECG echocardiography, chest Xray, and troponin test, especially if the symptoms persist. Additionally, you should also get your vitamin D levels checked, as vitamin D deficiency is common and can contribute to musculoskeletal pain. We also need to rule out other lung infections because such exposures often lead to infections, and the abovementioned investigations will help determine the cause. I suggest you use Diclofenac gel or spray topically for symptom relief. In conclusion, the first possibility is musculoskeletal pain, which should likely improve within three to four days and does not appear worrisome, but it should be evaluated. You may require vitamin D supplements based on the test results. I hope this has helped you. Kindly follow up if you have more doubts."}

I was on Ciprofloxacin for UTI about two weeks ago and Fluconazole for yeast infection. I did not finish antibiotic, still have six pills left.

However, I have had a new sex partner within that time frame and do not know if I am fine. I bought one of those vaginal infection kits to test and the stick stayed yellow.

I think your fungal infection of vagina and UTI urinary tract infection are still not resolved as I can see you having so much of fungal infection  plus you have not taken your antibiotics properly. So get urine routine examination and culture again and get blood sugar fasting also. We can also get a high vaginal swab for culture and sensitivity if the infection is not getting resolved. As you are having recurrent infection plus get your partner tested for semen culture and clinical exam to rule out STD sexually transmitted disease as the male partner are usually carrier and do not exhibit symptoms in some infections. Will start antibiotic after the culture report. For vaginal infection use Clotrimazole vaginal pessary daily for seven days.

{"context": "Will Inderal provoke wheezing and allergic episodes in cardiac patients?", "input": "Hi doctor,  I am a senior year medical student in Greece and I would like to ask you a question about my mother. She had a history of hyper/hypothyroidism about 10 years ago, but the last two years her thyroid has been managed and she stopped taking T4. Her cardiologist told her about 10 years ago to start taking Inderal (Propranolol 20 mg per day divided in a two time dose) because she had palpitations and some arrhythmias. She had an echo/ecg about a year ago and her heart was fine and her cardiologist suggested stopping Inderal. But being a very anxious person and having frequently anxiety tachycardias she did not stop it. Which brings me to the present, having been diagnosed the past six months by her pulmonologist with allergic rhinitis/asthma and having frequent wheezing episodes, even though she takes antihistamines when the episodes occur. Shouldn't she change her beta-blocker to a cardio-selective one? She finds herself not being able to breathe while on Inderal, but the symptoms reappear when she takes it. What would you recommend as a cardioselective beta-blocker? Would it be safe to change from Inderal, to let us say Atenolol? If yes, how would she do it?", "output": "I have gone through the history you have described for your mother. I really appreciate the way you have presented it with all details. It is very important to know the reason to start tablet Inderal at first point. What kind of arrhythmia it was and all in order to evaluate does she really need to continue any beta blocker. As your Cardiologist year ago after cardiac evaluation did not find any reason to continue the medication as per your history. As we see in a day to day practice patients with palpitations just due to anxiety or stress and without any cardiac issue, nonselective beta blockers would definitely aggravate her symptoms. BP you have mentioned in your description is wrong I guess. As it appears to be 1220 something, might be a type error but looks normal to me. For time being you can change the beta blocker to a selective beta blocker like Metaprolol 12.5 mg or Nebivolol 2.5 mg or Atenelol 25 mgon a very low dose. Get her evaluated again with her cardiac reports whenever possible and if not required better to slowly taper her beta blocker medication and stop as well. Because though cardioselective beta blockers has some or minimal effect on beta 2 receptors as well. Even I would advise to start meditation and yoga to overcome her anxiety issue, that will help her in controlling palpitations if they are related. Would like to review her all previous and recent cardiac records to further discuss and clarify management strategy."}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

When you are stressed, anxious or just exercised a hormone called epinefrin is released in your blood. Its effect accelerate your heart beat, raise blood pressure, palpitations and could cause the numbness in your hands that you reported. This hormone works only for a few minutes, so if your stress goes away or if you rest for some minutes the epinefrin effects goes away too.Therefore, if necessary, we must treat anxiety, control stress to ease those feelings. I suggest you look for a psychologist to help you with these problems. Taking care of these causes, it is very probable that the numbness and palpitations diminish or even go away.Hope I have answered your question.

Unfortunately you have not mentioned the age and weight of your child which would have significance in determining the cause of vomiting. The cause of vomiting in a newborn is likely to be different from that in a child of 1 year of age. Moreover, the dietary habits are also important. Vomiting is more likely in case of a formula fed infant than that of an exclusively breast fed infant.ORS should be given to a child in order to balance the salt and water lost through vomiting. In case the child is breast fed, breast feeding should be continued and given more rather than giving ORS. Emiset or domstal are supposed to reduce the frequency of vomiting. If the child is not well, often the child does not feed well.Blood should be tested to see if the CRP is elevated and if so, the child may require to be hospitalised.Frequency of urine will indicate if there is dehydration. In case of dehydration, frequency of urine will come down and indicate that intervention is required.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any"}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

{"context": "There is no improvement with tinnitus post surgery. Why?", "input": "Hello doctor, I am a 33 year old male. Two years back I had severe running nose and could not breathe through nose, especially during the night. Then, I was diagnosed with antrochoanal polyp in my right nose. After taking medications I no longer felt cold and running nose. However, my right nostril always remains blocked. So, I decided not to go for FESS and manage with blocked right nose. However, for the past three months, I started feeling right ear blockage and sometimes feel liquid movement in my right ear when I move my head. Over last 15 days I feel\u00a0ringing in my right ear, so I got shocked and got my right nose FESS surgery done. However, even after seven days of surgery I am not relieved of tinnitus although I can breathe now normally from both nostrils. I can feel reduction in volume and my pure tone audiometry is normal. Please help.", "output": "Hi. The nasal blockage did not cause tinnitus and hence, it is not relieved. The FESS surgery functional endoscopic sinus surgery you had was for nasal blockage and its consequences of auditory tube blockage and middle ear fluid retention. Now after surgery, your nose is opened, auditory tube and middle ear fluid must have settled down or will settle down and just a week after surgery you should not start calculating improvement. Coming to tinnitus, there are various causes. You need to be evaluated for it. Discuss with ENT ear, nose and throat surgeon on your next visit."}

I want your suggestion regarding treating such cases of CA of the gall bladder. .", "output": "This is most likely metastatic gall bladder cancer, as mentioned by the radiologist but needs a biopsy to confirm and to further characterize the tumor.

The only way to cure such tumors is surgery if detected at an early stage when the whole tumor can be removed. I hope this has helped you."}

Since you are asthmatic possibility of lower respiratory tract infection  LRTI  and worsening of asthma are more.So get done chest x ray to rule out LRTI. As chest pain is an indication of LRTI.

{"context": "", "input": "I think I may be pregnant.I had unprotected sex with my husband on March 29th, March 30th, and again this past Friday and Saturday (and yes, we are trying to conceive).Ive been experiencing symptoms:Aching, tingling, and sore nipples - I know that some women experience this during ovulation, but Ive NEVER experienced it. Its on and off. Some days, I can go all day without feeling any discomfort, on other days, I cant even bear to wear a bra.(Very) light nausea - I feel a little queasy first thing in the morning, as well as when Im hungry. I was also very queasy in the 3 days after I think we conceived (I vomited once, but that was it)Changes in appetite - I normally crave sweets and high-GI/high-GL carbs, but all of a sudden Im a meat lover. Chicken and eggs seem to be all I want lately (eggs used to make me gag, now I crave them all day long).Light cramping and spotting - Again, I know that some women experience this during ovulation and before their period, but Ive never experienced it during ovulation, and my period isnt due til the 20th (and Im always very regular, I get my period every 28-29 days)Changes in sleep patterns - No matter what time I go to sleep, I wake up at 8:30- 8:45 in the morning (this is new for me), and I CANT get enough sleep during the day. I feel the need to nap every 2 hours or so. Frequent urination - This one may just be in my head. Ive been going to the bathroom once every hour or so.Discharge - Almost immediately after the first time we had unprotected sex (like within the following 24 hours), I noticed an rapid increase in milky, odorless, translucent white vaginal discharge. Could this be a symptom?Increased libido and vaginal sensitivity - This past weekend (about a week after I think we conceived), sex with my husband was more intense than it ever has been... I was more aroused and sensitive than Ive ever been with him, and he commented that I felt tighter than usual. Could this be caused by thickening of the vaginal walls that takes place in pregnancy?Increased attachment to my husband - Im not sure if this is a symptom, but Ive been feeling a need to be with him at all times... I miss him terribly when I leave his house (or when he leaves mine), and I get sad when we get off the phone (I even cried when we got off the phone last night). I toss and turn when I sleep alone, but I sleep very peacefully when Im with him. This is very new for me, as Ive always been very independent. I crave his affection, and when Im with him, it feels like everything inside me is sighing in relief... Ive always been very much in love with him, but my feelings for him seem to be much more intense now.As I said earlier, my period isnt due until the 20th, as my last one started on March 23rd (and ended on March 26th). I know that most women ovulate 14 days after their period, but I also know that other women ovulate almost immediately after. While Im not exactly sure, I think I may be one of the latter.Also, Im young (20 years old), so I know that Im at an advantage when it comes to fertility.Im in serious need of professional advice... Waiting for my period to arrive (or not arrive) is driving me crazy and I dont want to stress myself out of my period or psych myself into psuedopregnancy.Does it sound like Im pregnant? Or are these symptoms simply a result of my longing for a baby? How should I deal with the stress and worry of waiting to know for sure?Thank you in advance!", "output": "hellothanks for your query. i appreciate the in depth query posted by you. to be very objective at the risk of sounding harsh, the only way to confirm a pregnancy is to have a positive pregnancy test. and the earliest that you could perform a pregnancy test is when you miss a period. yes, you should destress yourself and relax until the proper time comes. there is absolutely no point in venturing into the realm of guesswork. all the best."}

As you are experiencing new symptoms, you should see a rheumatologist. He has to do a physical exam to you, in way to detect the cause of your pains. Your doctor might ask you to bend in different directions to test the range of motion in your spine. He or she might try to reproduce your pain by pressing on specific portions of your pelvis or by moving your legs into a particular position. Also, your doctor might ask you to take a deep breath to see if you have difficulty expanding your chest.You should have a Xray to check for changes in your joints and bones, also.An MRI may be necessary to provide moredetailed images of bones and soft tissues.Meanwhile you should take in consideration that the main treatment of Ankilosis Spondylitis remains the fisical activity. It would be better to begin the exercises after a shower with warm water which will help you with the stiffness. Swimming, volleyball, etc are the main activities which help decreasing the pain level and conserving the normal posture of your body. Is recommended to stay overthrown for 1520 minutes for several times a day. If the symptoms does not improve with the fisical activity and the antiinflammatory drugs CODICLOMISO 75MG, then you have to see a reumatologist for more specific treatment.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards,"}

Other than that her health is very good. She had surgery a few month ago to clear blockage in her carotid artery. She is a former smoker but relatively good health.", "output": "well the surgical procedure is a fairly easy one and since they say its a small bleed chances are it has not caused severe permanent damage to the brain. of course, they mention her age as the main issue because old people carry a higher complication risk for any type of surgery especially with general anesthesia, respiratory complications, infections, thrombosis etc. hopefully that wont be her case, but doctors have to inform you of any possible scenario."}

Yesterday afternoon when I got home from school I started to get chest discomfort and pain on the left side of my chest and I feel like I'm not breathing properly through my left nostril. I tried to sleep it off but today I feel the same way. There is mucus or anything. It just feels like I'm having a hard time breathing to get oxygen through the left side of my chest. What's wrong with me?", "output": "Such a pain can result from various causes. Commonly, its something we like to call  pleuritis or a pleuritic pain. The pleura is a membrane covering the lungs. It can get inflamed and cause severe pain on inhalation sometimes. But your description is not specific enough to make such a diagnosis. I would recommend to see your family physician, and perhaps get a chest Xray."}

Came and not allowed to be any gym", "output": "Since you dont mention to have had any MRI lately we are left only with the tingling and movement disorder which is a little unclear. Tingling can be a manifestation of MS but so can it be a manifestation of many brain lesions. In your case given your history with the accident, the coma and subsequent seizures it is to be assumed that a brain lesion has happened due to the accident and it has left a damaged area which could well justify the symptoms.So to conclude I would consider it far more likely the symptoms to be due to the brain injury rather than you having a whole new neurological condition frankly what are the chances of that on top of what you already have. In order to completely exclude MS an MRI can be scheduled.I hope to have been of help."}

However, a work colleague is pregnant and I have been told that I cannot go back into work until I find out if I am a carrier or not? How do I find this out?", "output": "If you have had chickenpox in the past, you are immune. You cannot be a carrier.

During the investigations, they discovered that I have a nodule in my upper right lung, a cyst on my spleen and an enlarged liver and spleen. I have been suffering from symptoms of extreme muscle/tendon pain, particularly in the morning when I get out of bed (can barely walk), fatigue and pale, beige coloured stool (for the past month). I have pain in my right arm, left hand (middle finger), ribs (back and sides), entire back, neck, hips, legs and achilles tendons/heels. I am scheduled for another CT scan with contrast in about 2 weeks and a mammogram and am on Warfarin 6 mg/day. They cannot seem to keep me at a therapeutic level on the Warfarin.

{"context": "Narcolepsy, masturbating in sleep. Naming stranger during episodes. Help", "input": "Hi: I had a lumbar puncture with flouroscopy Friday afternoon. Now, two days later, I have excruciating pain all over my body, especially my legs. There is also pain in right flank at diaphragm, and hurts when I breath. Upon puncturing the lumbar area, I experienced an electric strong pain in my right sciatic nerve that shot down radiating to my right foot causing my leg to kick once uncontrollably. I said oh I think you hit my sciatic nerve! When the Dr pulled back on the needle, the pain stopped, but the leg felt numb. The pain was not this bad yesterday, but now even with my very potent meds for chronic back pain, the pain is very bad. I am stuck in bed and starting to get head and neck pain too. I have some arachnoiditis in the lumbar area from four spinal surgeries at L5 - S1. The radiology Dr said my cord area is very narrow as it was very difficult to obtain CSF. The puncture was done prone for the xray and then I had to roll onto left side for collection of CSF. It was barely dripping out. It took about 30 min. to get 6 cc. Is this pain normal?? I see many people on the site talking about the needle hitting the sciatic nerve, and the xray tech said it happened a lot at the facility I went to....Is it common that the sciatic nerve is hit upon needle entry? I would appreciate any advise as it is Sunday..... everything closed but ER.", "output": "Hi,Your symptoms suggest that you have experienced two sideeffects of the lumbar puncture. Firstly, you have experienced some nerve irritation or damage during the procedure. This is likely to recover but may take a few days to show an improvement. It is a recognised occurrence during a lumbar puncture. Secondly, the head, neck and body pain that has started is also due to the puncture but is not nerve damage. It is due to leakage of CSF through the hole made by the needle and, again, is a recognised problem with a lumbar puncture. My suggestion is that you continue to take your pain meds. Lie down and rest as this may relieve the head and neck ache to some degree. Keep well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Caffeinated drinks will also help with the pain. These measures are likely to ease the pains.If you do not feel significantly better in 24 hours, I suggest you contact the clinic where you had the procedure done for further advice. I hope you feel better soon.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB FRCA"}

They are small dots but feel bumpy to the touch. It itches or burns only when I sweat. They come and go but have flaky skin when they are not itching.

I have had them for over two weeks and have seen my general practitioner, who ordered me a blood test to test all the possibilities. My blood test came back fine. I am healthy with no deficiencies. So he could not determine what the rash was. I have had hives, which usually appear all over my body. So he ruled out that, and I am not allergic to any food or medicine. I do not take any medication, and I have a very strict healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and chicken that I have followed for years. I did not change body wash, nor have I changed any eating habits. I take showers twice daily and wash all my clothing and bedding regularly. .", "output": "Fungal infection indeed is very problematic if it becomes recurrent. You keep these precaution in mind and follow it regularly. I would suggest do not keep the affected area wet. Use powder frequently to keep it dry. Avoid itching and do not scratch the affected area.

Continue medicine for long time to completely kill the fungus causing infection. Avoid excessive sweating and wet cloths. Check diabetes and thyroid it is really recurrent even after proper treatment. Now treatment part, I would suggest using Ketoconazole cream and tablet Terbinafine Terbinafine hydrochloride 250 mg for two months or Terbinafine cream and tablet Fluconazole 150 mg twice in week for two months.

Secondly to really find out if the wound is uninfected you will have to visit you doctor because infected would doesnt necessarily mean lots of pus . As far as the advise of you doctor is concerned to under go a surgery , i say it would be a wise decision because no matter what medication your daughter takes or how clean you keep the wound , the wound will not heal if the ends of the wound have not be approximated . This will quickly start the healing process with very good antibiotics with broad spectrum coverage . She might be reluctant ,but if you counsel her that surgical intervention again has good chances of healing your wound , i am sure she will be ready. After all its going to be under general anesthesia and she wouldnt feel a thing. I hope the answer was helpful . In case you have any further questions feel free to contact in writing . Regards.

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

I have gone through your query regarding Infected sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts are common non cancerous cysts of the skin. Common tests used for a sebaceous cyst include Physical examination Medical history CT scans, helps to find the best route for surgery and to spot abnormalities ultrasounds, which identify the contents of the cyst punch biopsy, which involves removal of a small amount of tissue from the cyst to be examined in a laboratory for signs of cancer A sebaceous cyst is treated by draining it or by surgically removing it. Normally, cysts are removed. This isnt because theyre dangerous but rather for cosmetic reasons. Since most cysts arent harmful to your health, you can choose the treatment option that works for you. Its important to remember that without surgical removal, your cyst will usually come back. The best treatment is to ensure complete removal through surgery. Some people do decide against surgery, however, because it can cause scarring. One of these methods are followed for cyst removal1. Conventional wide excision, which completely removes a cyst but can leave a long scar.2. Minimal excision, which causes minimal scarring but carries a risk that the cyst will return.3. Laser with punch biopsy excision, which uses a laser to make a small hole to drain the cyst of its contents After your cyst is removed, you can use antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. You should use this until the healing process is complete. You can also use a scar cream to reduce the appearance of any surgical scars. Hope I have answered your query.

Is it mandatory to get the surgery done now itself or can I wait for three to four months?", "output": "A pilonidal sinus is more common among men who 1. Have more hard body hair. 2. Have long working hours sitting down. 3. Obese. Unfortunately, surgery is the best option for you in going forward. However, as the recovery period can be a lengthy one, you may hold off on surgery for a few months provided the discharge from the sinus is not bothering you too much and is not painful. Whilst you decide on when to get it operated, you should continue to maintain local hygiene, keep the area as dry as possible, and remove any hair in the area. That being said, the longer you leave it, the more problematic it might become due to infection, and worsening of the sinus. If you do not wish to undergo a surgical procedure, there is the option of opting for laser treatment or trying various creams. I should warn you that either of these is less successful than treating it surgically."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

I had sex two times, and each time I wore two condoms, which was intact after sex but appeared that it had come a little front from my body side. I also filled water in the condom before throwing and confirmed that it had no breakage as water did not come out. She had bit me near ear and the next day a mosquito bit me at the same place and I had a swelling there for some two days. Due to anxiety, I started having Bromhexine (for mucus) syrup and Ulgel-A (antacid). I also lost weight during this time. I had taken a liver protection injection later. I underwent an HIV(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) Elisa(Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test (12 weeks after sex, 89 days after sex), the result was negative. Would Bromhexine, Ulgel or liver protection injection interfere with the Elisa test? Or can I consider this test as conclusive? Later, I got two swellings one in my hand other in my neck. The swelling in the neck went off in two days. Again I get some sort of swelling in hand and in the leg a small size lump appeared, and it disappeared within few hours. I am noticing this happening frequently from three days, however, two of such lump have turned red. Earlier, I used to get infected very easily by cold and throat infection even before I had sex. Could that be a pre-existing immunodeficiency? Given all this, can I conclude that HIV Elisa test (12 weeks after sex, 89 days after sex) as conclusive? Or should I have another test after six months?", "output": "Let me answer your question step by step Your chances of contracting HIV or for that matter any other STI sexually transmitted infection was nonexistent with the consistent and corrective use of a condom. You had mentioned that there was a slight slippage of the condom and it is assumed that you had a low risk of contracting HIV or any other STI if the other person will be having it. The ELISA testing kits for HIV used these days are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. Your negative HIV test at three months of exposure is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. Majority 99.9 of the people who are infected with HIV after exposure, develop antibodies by three months. So, your negative test result is quite reassuring. There are very rare cases of late seroconversion or positive antibody response at six months has also been reported in the literature. There are recommendations and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the rapid HIV antibody test at six months of last exposure and if that will be negative, you need not to repeat it further. The symptoms which you have mentioned could be due to various other causes or just due to anxiety also. There are no HIV specific symptoms or signs. Relax, as you have crossed three months hurdle. I suggest you to get your routine hemogram, biochemistry, fasting blood sugar, thyroid profile and lipid profile done. I hope this helps."}

They thought it was an emergency and were prepared to do emergency surgery, but they did an ultrasound both normal and pelvic to be sure. I ended up not needing emergency surgery and was sent home. I called the next day to try to visit a gynecologist for this as I am in all sorts of pain.

It's been 2 days since I started duphaston.. So wil this be a problem for ovulating? If so, can I stop the medicine now.. I'm afraid it'll cause withdrawal bleeding now.. Pls clarify", "output": "Hallow Dear, Clomid is Clomiphene citrate which helps release of the eggs in patients who fail to ovulate. My advice to you would be 1. Start Clomid pills from day 2 onwards for 5 days. Do not carry on with these pills for more than 6 cycles. If you fail to conceive even after 6 cycles of Clomiphene trial, switch over to some other medicines like HMChCG combination for induction of ovulation. 2. From day 9 onwards, submit yourself for ovulation monitoring. The follicles between 18 mm and 21 mm in size release healthiest eggs. So when the follicle is of 18 mm size, Inj. hCG may be given for inducing the ovulation. After that, you should have at least alternate day intercourse for next 3 days. 3. The Endometrium uterine lining should be between 9 mm and 14 mm in thickness at the time of ovulation. 4. Duphaston may be taken after the ovulation has effected and confirmed taken before ovulation may interfere the egg release. 5. Please get your tubal patency and uterine cavity evaluated by Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy. 6. Husbands sperms should be evaluated for quantity and quality by semen examination after 4 days of sexual abstinence. I hope this provides you preliminary guidelines.

{"context": "Can I get HIV infection from the women's saliva if it contacted my sores in the penis?", "input": "I want a solution for my anxiety. I had a protected blowjob, but the lady placed the condom with her mouth while my penis had a small sore. The skin is slightly burned and exposed with no blood going out. I am worried about HIV or STD exposure because saliva before placing the condom might touch the penis head or the injured skin. I can become calm as the protected oral has no risk of HIV. However, my mind is shifting to another scenario where I have used her bathroom, and maybe there is semen left out from the other men. I was accidentally exposed to it from the towel or the toilet room. Can you please guide me on what I should do if I get tested? I cannot do anything with these thoughts, as they occupy my mind 24/7. Please help me. Also, after the exposure within two days, I tested positive for COVID-19, and I recovered after a week while I read that HIV and COVID-19 share the same symptoms. So should I have an HIV test, or what should I do? I also have a persistent sore throat.", "output": "You stated that you had a history of blow jobs with a lady wearing a condom. But during the time of a blow job, saliva may enter the head of the penis. Usually, blowjob or oral sex is not likely to transmit HIV. HIV cannot ever be transmitted through saliva. So do not be worried at all. The towel is an innate substance where HIV cannot live. After semen comes from the penis and is exposed to air, it may begin to dry up. As drying happens, HIV becomes damaged and inactive. They are no longer infectious. So, by using the bathroom or towels of others, someone will never be affected by HIV infection. So, you do not need any investigations to confirm HIV infection."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

These all spices can cause these symptoms. It would have been much easier for me if you have mentioned the temperature in figures. Temperature less than 100.05 is not a significant one, since the normal body temperature can rise up to this amount of level due to climate change and hydration status of the human body. The diarrhea can cause dehydration loss of water in body and hence can cause some increase in the body temperature. Beside Impdoium, I suggest you to take Oral rehydration solution ORS. Take one sachet of ORS, add in 1 liter of water, and take it frequently up to 3 liters in a day. Or take 300 ml every time you have loose motion. Only with ORS I hope your problem will be solved. In case your symptoms does not get better, I suggest you to follow, as I can suggest some thorough investigations to rule out some causes.

Last Saturday 14 July he suffered from fever I gave him paracitamol 125mg syrup after three days fever had gone on Friday 20 July I noticed that he passes dark yellowish color urine I take the sample of urine for lab. The test shows Bilirubin 357 points I go through rapid malaria test it comes negative result What treatment you suggest for him? What precaution should be taken? Which diet is good during the period?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for using the HCM. I am happy to address your questions, jaundice is a symptom of many medical problems but it is most often associated with conditions of the liver or the gallbladder. Jaundice causes yellow skin and eyes because of an excess amount of the bile pigment bilirubin in the fat layer under the skin. Either the body is producing too much, or its not getting rid of it fast enough. The liver breaks down old, inefficient red blood cells in a process called hemolysis. This releases large amounts of bilirubin. Some causes of jaundice due to poor liver function include viral hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E can all cause temporary liver inflammation. Types B and C can also cause chronic, lifelong inflammation. Cause of jaundice due to obstruction blockage include gallstones formed in the gallbladder, other can be due to excessive red blood cell destruction as in malaria, the liver destroys red blood cells infected with the parasite. If a fever or flulike illness comes before jaundice, its usually a sign of a viral hepatitis infection. Brown urine, common in hepatitis, is generally a sign of poor liver function or increased red blood cell destruction. The body is trying to get rid of excess bilirubin in the urine. Pale, white, or claycoloured stool, on the other hand, is an indicator of obstruction in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Jaundice itself is unlikely to hurt you unless the bilirubin reaches very high concentrations. It is a sign, however, of an underlying problem. Would recommend you show your child to a doctor if you think you have jaundice. A blood sample will also be taken and checked for hepatitis virus antibodies, abnormal red blood cells, bilirubin levels, and various other substances that give clues about liver function. Your doctor may also order other tests such as an ultrasound to determine the cause of jaundice. Theres no treatment for jaundice as such, since its not a disease but a sign of a medical problem. The approach is to treat the underlying cause, if possible. Many, like hepatitis A, arent curable but go away on their own. Usually treatment is unnecessary. Conditions like chronic hepatitis are lifelong problems that may cause permanent or recurring jaundice. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

I had a miscarriage before i started on the depo shot. I had one shot & didnt like it so i switched to the pill after about 3 months of being on the pill I ended up in the ER with a PE in my right lung they weren t sure what has caused it im not the healthiest I m over weight and don t eat the best. But im not lazy, 2 weeks before this I had been given a promotion to be a Store Manager. So i was super stressed out but working 70 hours a week, & not just sitting at my desk so they ruled that wasn t the cause. So they assumed it was a mix of smoking & birth control & stress ,tho they still thought i was too young. So they started me on blood thinners kept me for 4 days & released me to be on Xarlto for 6 months. With follow up appts & to a specialist who had a bunch of blood test ran. Turned out I have a protein S deficiency & the pills triggered it.

I m not sure yet if I want kids so I don t just want to completely cut that option out just yet & I m def not ready for one now & if or when I m pregnant I have to be on the blood thinners throughout the pregnancy.

{"context": "My scalp is inflamed and itchy after using Kaolin clay and tea tree oil. Kindly help.", "input": "About two months ago, I used a coal tar shampoo mistakenly because I thought it would help remove a reaction I had to fenugreek, where I was constantly itching and flaking. Then, about three weeks ago, I washed my hair with 100% kaolin clay, undiluted tea tree oil, and apple cider vinegar. I realized the tea tree oil gave me allergic contact dermatitis. My scalp was feeling inflamed, sore, itchy, and stinging. So, I went out to the pharmacy and bought a Hydrocortisone ointment and Levocetirizine for the allergy. I applied Hydrocortisone to the affected areas twice on Monday and once on Tuesday. I also took Levocetirizne on that same days. My inflammation is now gone, and my scalp is also cleansed. One thing I have been feeling on my scalp, however, is slight tingling on the areas I applied the Hydrocortisone ointment. The tingling is not that bad, and I do not always feel it. I just randomly feel it at times. So, my questions are, what is still causing that tingling feeling? Is it due to Hydrocortisone? How do I treat the tingling sensation so it can completely go away? Did I do something wrong?", "output": "Hydrocortisone ointment is a type of steroid. Most Hydrocortisone are mild, and they are used in the treatment of eczema, insect bites, and, in your case, for treating contact dermatitis. There are points to be kept in mind while using Hydrocortisone ointment. It should not be applied to broken skin. There should not be any infection over the area. If you are using it twice a day, there should be a gap of eight to twelve hours between the application. For contact dermatitis, oneweek treatment is sufficient. Some patients get a burning or stinging feeling after putting on the cream. This stops happening after you have been using the cream for a few days. Also, you can change to the cream form of Hydrocortisone. The cream form is milder than the ointment. I hope this helps."}
{"context": "Should I take an emergency contraceptive pill along with Diane 35?", "input": "Hi. My girlfriend and I had sex december 13. but the condom broke and i wasn t aware when I came inside of her. she usually takes birth control pills. one month ago, she stopped taking the rest of her pack, because she missed a few already. 2 weeks ago, she started taking her regular birth control pills again. We had sex 18 days after her first menstrual day (she was already 18 pills into her current pack). Since this is the first time that this happened, we bought nordette, and she took it an hour after our little accident . So, in conclusion, she took nordette on top of her regular medicine. She was irregular before, but has been taking her regular pills; she s been regular for about 2 months already. So, is taking nordette on top of her regular medicine dangerous? What are the chances of pregnancy?", "output": "Hi,Your notes are very clear. So it is very easy to answer.If she has been taking birth control pills regularly as per the instructions then it is  99 effective in preventing pregnancy. There was no need to take Nordette. Since you have taken Nordette too The chances of pregnancy are almost nil.Taking Nordette on top of her regular medicine is not dangerous.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

Please advise..Thank you", "output": "hi.thanks for posting query at HCM.yes, gallstones or liver inflammation may result in pain below the rib cage on the right side.cause of high liver enzymes should be properly investigated.viral causes should be ruled out.fatty liver disease should be ruled out.advise  advice  abstinence from Alcohol  if alcoholic  LOW fat diet should be followed, AVOID junk food and beverages decreased oil consumption oily food NO red meat green vegetables should be ingested daily use lemon juice lemonade once in a day reduce weight if overweightobeserecheck liver enzymes after 6 to 8 weeks andor ultrasound.if gallstones are seen on ultrasound and pain is frequent, then visit a general surgeon for advise.1. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid  UDCA for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size  weight reduction and lowfat diet is also a part of medical therapy.2. Surgery lasts for less than one hour  usually half an hour. Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion."}

I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.", "output": "I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."}

The antibiotics did not help so I went to an ENT who said it could be related to a migraine and stress and that he did not see any infection, he prescribed a medrol pack for 6 days. Still no relief so now I am going to get a MRI of the brain tomorrow. I recently had a root canal and the pain is in different areas of my right side of my head. It hurts sometimes on top, up thru my nose and upper jaw and mostly the area behind my right ear. I sometimes feel a little light headed and my head like when I get a sinus infection.Do you have any suggestions", "output": "the type of pain you are experiencing is also felt if oral cavity or temporomandibular joint tmj has focus of infection. as you have recently been through root canal treatment, i suppose that the dentist must have checked your other teeth and may have informed you if any of them is infected. so we are ruling out infected tooth as a cause for pain you are having now. the other possibility is tmj problem. this joint is associated with opening and closing of jaws along with side to side movements of the lower jaw. the problems with this joint are often felt in ear and can be felt up to temple and behind the ear. the upper jaw and nose might feel referred pain. thus, before going for diagnosis of brain problems and mri, i would advise you to visit a dentist or oral  maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the tmj. if they rule out any problem with the joint or oral cavity, you should go for mri of brain. i hope this information helps you. i wish you feel better soon. best,"}

{"context": "", "input": "Thank you doctor, and I appreciate the quick response. Like stated earlier, I ve always had a fear of the doctors. Whenever something I thought was seriously wrong I always confided in my mom, and she would always reassure me that I would be ok. She was right 100%. Now that she is no longer here, I have nobody to go to, so I appreciate you understanding where I m coming from. Four years ago I was diagnosed with a slight thing of anxiety. My doctor prescribed me alpralozam. The pills expired in 2012. They helped cause they just took the edge off. My grandmother, grandfather, uncle, and mom have passed away within these past 3 years. It s too much to handle all at once. They all went into the hospital, and never made it out, so that s the way my mind thinks. I think if I go into the hospital, that I ll never make it back out. Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but that s how I think. About a month ago I had this slight pain between my thumb and index finger. Again, nothing serious, probably just a bruise, but I took it to the extreme. First thing I did, was search up online if there are glands in your hands. Of course there are, so right away I think it s a swollen gland and something is wrong. I worried about that for a couple days, and must have tensed myself up so bad that my fingers started to ache and hurt. So, right away I start thinking the worse. Why are my hands and fingers hurting now. I worried about that for a week. Sure enough the pain between my thumb and finger, went away. This brings me up to now, where I must ve worried myself so much about my fingers and hands that it cause what I hope is anxiety. About a week after all of this happening, I woke up last Saturday and stood up and felt like I was off balance. Nothing serious, figured it was just allergies. It got better throughout the day, and would come and go. Again, thinking crazy, got it in my head that it was something serious, like a brain tumor, brain hemorage, etc. I would constantly search up symptoms of all those things and worry myself day in and day out. This past Monday, 2 days after this occurred I sucked it up and went to the doctor. She checked me out. My BP was 115/75, my lungs and heart both sounded good. I explained this situation and she said to just relax myself. Once I left that doctors office, I didn t feel a thing. I felt like myself. Sure enough, as time went on, that feeling came back. It sucks and I hate it. That s how this whole past week has been. I wake up, and im fine. As the day goes by, I start worrying that the feeling is going to come back. Because I worry, the feeling comes back. It s like a catch 22. During the week, Monday through Friday I woke from 2:30 to 11 at night. I stay busy at work, and for the most part I feel fine. Once we take a break, even though the people I work with talk to me, it s in the back of my head that what if it comes back, and sure enough iy does. It seems like once my mind starts to wander, it comes back. This past weekend it was tough too, especially yesterday. I was fine and then once I sat down with my girlfriend, my mind started going. I had the worst naseau, and I had minor little headaches. I honestly don t know what to do, and I worry myself everyday that I have something seriously wrong with me. I m so afraid of cancer and always think I have a brain tumor or something wrong inside my head that is going to kill me. What are the main symptoms of a brain tumor? Do you think it s anything to be concerned about? Or is it just all in my head? Like I said, it s more of a foggyness feeling. Thanks again doctor, hope to hear from you soon.", "output": "i suggest you not to worry much. i can see that you are suffering from health anxiety disorder, referred also as hypochondriacs. you are obsessed yourself with health problems as you are already aware. but you can also notice that these obsessive thoughts comes only when you are not busy. once you are busy, you do your job, not thinking. understanding life and learning how to enjoy life are the keys. you can learn these by observing your experiences, elders, surroundings etc. you can also visit a psychological counselor for further advice. if you feel that i can be of help to you, feel free to post a direct question to me and am obliged to serve your cause. i shall prescribe cognitive behavioral therapy techniques tailormade for you to clear your problems. hope this answers your query. available for further clarifications. good luck."}

{"context": "Why do periods get delayed after first time sex?", "input": "Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.\u00a0After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?", "output": "As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIUmL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses."}

When she had the cysts before they were far bigger and they did not feel as hard and they were not fixed, they also caused her alot of pain.The lump is in the same breast but in the upper right part of the breast. I know the doctor is thinking breast cancer by the look on his face and the fact he was lost for words. Please can you tell me in your honest opinion what you think? Or if this lump is benign...what else could it be? if this is a Cyst, why are the symptoms so different?  Many thanks for your time", "output": "Hi.Noted the history of Aspirated Cysts, now pea sized lump in right breast and swollen armpits.Cancer is least likely almost not heard of at the age of 17 years. The lump in the breast can be cyst which has reappeared and got fixed due to previous aspiration tract. This is not frankly infected hence appears hard and does not hurt. Simple ultrasonography and guided FNAC will give the diagnosis.The swollen armpit can be due to lymph nodes secondary to the breast lesion or have been a part of hidradenitis common in this age of 17 years. Ultrasonography will help here too go for an FNAC of the armpit swelling too."}

No pain or discharge or itching means the infection has subsided, but a point you have to understand is that you got this infection only after you had sex. So your fiance is the source of the infection. So he too should have the same course of antibiotics. Treatment is never complete without both partners being treated. So he will not get inflammation, he will infect you again and your old symptoms will reappear.

These tests were conducted three times. At the time of the test, I was taking anticoagulants Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) for deep vein thrombosis. I used to binge drink to the point where I would blackout during the last year. This year I have been drinking less, and since the diagnosis, I have stopped drinking completely. I would like to have a second opinion about my state and how certain I can be that I actually have cirrhosis. .", "output": "I saw the reports you have uploaded, and well, this is cirrhosis. A kPa kilopascal value of more than 12 is considered fibrosis or cirrhosis, and your kPa value is 15. So the current state of your liver function is assessed by some blood tests plus an ultrasound of the abdomen, which I recommend you to get. Alcoholic cirrhosis is one of those conditions where cirrhosis can actually reverse if alcohol is completely stopped. Given your alcohol intake, it will definitely make things worse for you. If you feel difficulty stopping alcohol by yourself, get help from a moderator, psychologist, or psychiatrist. They will give you medications for removing cravings and controlling withdrawal symptoms when stopping alcohol. The blood tests that you need to go through are the following 1 Complete blood count. 2 Total bilirubin you did not mention this test in the current liver function tests reports. 3 Renal function tests. 4 Albumin. 5 Alfa fetoprotein. 6 Prothrombin time and INR International Normalized Ratio. 7 Ultrasound abdomen to look for portal hypertension. Once we have the above blood tests and your ultrasound report, I will be able to tell you your current prognosis of the condition. I hope this helps."}

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

This may have created some hormone imbalance. Hormone imbalances are common during the initial months of hormone contraception and result in several menstrual irregularities like intermenstrual spottingbleeding, heavy bleeding or scanty periods, absent periods etc. Once the body adjusts to the new hormone milieu, stability is attained. In this scenario, I would ask you to contact your health care provider for a proper appraisal of the situation and either adjust the doses or add progesteronestyptics to control the bleeding and regularize it. Supplementary treatment is essential to make up for the loss. Hope this helps."}

We are now concerned about the abnormal report.", "output": "I have seen the ECG of your daughter. . She has a condition called right bundle branch block. A right bundle branch block RBBB is a heart block in the electrical conduction system. Our heart is divided into four chambers, upper two are called atria and the lower two are called ventricle. Every heartbeat starts from the sinoatrial node in the right atria called pacemaker of the heart and is conducted to ventricles through bundle branches arising from bundle of HIS in the ventricle. The right bundle branch supplies the right ventricle while the left bundle branch supplies the left bundle. During a right bundle branch block, the right ventricle is not directly activated by impulses traveling through the right bundle branch. The left ventricle, however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. Though in 85 of adult population RBBB is a normal finding, yet as your daughter is in the pediatric age group it can be because of atrial septal defect also.

Is there any reason for concern that my body is resistant to Cipro and that I have had a bladder infection for this long", "output": "Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Your doctor intends to inform you that the bacteria causing your bladder infection are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report. Some of the highly specific antibiotics for urinary infections include nitrofurantoin and newer cephalosoprins. This will be decided by your doctor and you must complete the course for quick recovery.Hope thishelps"}

{"context": "My PTH level keeps on increasing. Should I suspect malignancy?", "input": "I am a 31-year-old mother of two kids. I am nursing my 10 months old baby. I am in a dilemma. Last December, due to a chronic sore throat, my family doctor asked me to do thyroid ultrasound. There was nothing abnormal with my thyroid, however, they made me do a CT scan as well with contrast. In between my TSH and T3 were all normal. They suspected parathyroid adenoma in my ultrasound and CT scans. Due to COVID situation, my treatment got prolonged. Since they were looking for parathyroid adenoma, they made me do nuclear medicine scan in June. Also, I did my blood work too. In our place, we are unable to see any doctor of our choice or repeat any scans or even blood works without concerned doctor's requisition. Also, reports are not accessible too. My last month blood work result is PTH level is 0.59 ng/dL (indicated high). Calcium - 2.35 mEq/L(normal). My TSH level is still within normal limits. In the month of January my PTH level was 0.5 ngl/dL. Now that my parathyroid scan rules out adenoma, they are asking me to do a mammogram and ultrasound of right axilla lymph node. To be frank, I have not yet got any appointments to do either of these. I am not in a position to come to India in this COVID circumstance. I am really desperate and so much worried. What could be the reason of my increasing level of parathyroid hormone? Is it malignancy like what they are suspecting or lymph node cancer? I really feel pathetic.", "output": "I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have hyperparathyroidism. They will find out all causes of hyperparathyroidism. Since they cannot find any cause for hyperparathyroidism they will search for everything and rule out everything. This is usually done to be on the safe side that we checked everything possible and then nothing was found so now you will simply follow up for parathyroid hormone levels only. Yes, cancer is one of the suspicions so they will scan the breast and axillary lymph nodes and these are simple scans not biopsies so relax and try to do it once you can. Until then, do not worry and be positive. It does not look that bad to be scared."}

Also, some other parameters are slightly higher or lower than the average level. Raised absolute eosinophils count in blood is known as absolute eosinophilia. Absolute eosinophilia may result from some health conditions such as parasitic Infections, allergic reactions, drug reactions, any Infections, inflammation, or carcinoma. Symptoms of Eosinophilia are itching, rashes, asthma, diarrhea due to parasitic infestations, runny nose due to allergies, etc. Your eosinophilia is mild because eosinophil count over 500 to 1500 cellsmcL is considered mild eosinophilia. Also, your current medication, like tablet Hydrochlorothiazide may cause absolute eosinophilia, according to the research. Similarly, thiazide diuretics like Hydrochlorothiazide may also worsen carbon dioxide retention due to electrolyte imbalance and can cause raised carbon dioxide levels in the blood.

Many types of research have been done on dream interpretation but there are no conclusions yet as to what suggests what. Some researchers say dreams have no purpose or meaning and are nonsensical activities of the sleeping brain. Others say dreams are necessary for mental, emotional, and physical health. Studies have shown the importance of dreams to our health and wellbeing. In one study, researchers woke subjects just as they were drifting off into REM sleep. They found that those who were not allowed to dream experienced Increased tension, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, lack of coordination, weight gain, tendency to hallucinate. Nightmares, or bad dreams, are common in children and adults. Often nightmares are caused by Stress, conflict, and fear, trauma, emotional problems, medication or drug use, illness. If you have a recurring nightmare, your subconscious may be trying to tell you something. Listen to it. If you cannot figure out why you are having bad dreams, and you continue to have them, I can help you figure out what is causing your nightmares and provide tips to put you at ease. In your case, you must be having an emotional issue with your friend and you are stressed due to that. Keep in mind that no matter how scary a nightmare is, it is not real and most likely will not happen to you in real life. Therefore, do not worry about any dreams at all. Worry may further stress you and may sometime make you be obsessive on those thoughts which may further develop into depression. Ignore those dreams. Engage in your day to day activities. Increase your physical activity level so that you sleep well and sound at night. Take care."}

But I also have dilated cardiomyopathy which I have medication for! And Atriil fibiration! When I rest it seems to be ok but when I get up and move around my heart beats quite fast??", "output": "Greetings. Usually, during flu and other infectious issues in the organism, that are accompanied with fever, there is a hyperdinamic state and the organism has to regulate itself to cope with this strain. One of the compensatory mechanisms in hyperdinamic states is the rapid heart rate. Furthermore, the centre of temperature regulation in the human body is settled in the hypothalamus, the highest regulator in the brain. Due to this engagement, also the heart rate goes up. This insufficient heart cannot cope as easily as a normal heart with a workload put onto it. Therefore, also here, the heart rate compensates as much as it can, for the strain put onto the heart. To illustrate it more figuratively to understand it more clearly, imagine the heart is a donkey, and an enlarged heart is like an old donkey, and it is clear that the two donkeys cannot cope in the same way with the same loads put on their back. However, if this is an enlarged heart caused by ischemic reason, then an antiarrhythmic such as amiodarone, would be appropriate to treat or prevent this supraventricular arrhythmia. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to ask again. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"}

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

However, if I considered drug allergy the top of the list will be hydromorphone that is an opioid analgesic and can cause direct mast cell histamine release WITHOUT any allergy  specific antibodies. There is now a blood test available for those who want to exclude morphine allergy, specific IgE against morphine. Pain killers can also cause direct mast cell degranulation and antihistamines are very helpful.

That was over 10 years ago. 2 years ago abnormal cells were again present and my doctor performed the LEEP procedure. The pathology report after that came back showing remaining cells, then I had I pap or two that would be normal, now back to having low grade abnormal cells. He has in talking mentioned performing a hysteroectomy and leaving the overies. I am meeting with my doctor tomorrow for another 3 month follow up Pap test, and I have really decided that I am ready to be done with all of this. I think it is time to get it over with. My hormonal history is another story it is a disaster, a battle with severe depression, cystic acne, horible PMS ever since my teens, mood swings that my family is just suffering from and I have been treated with medications for anger, irritability to the extreme.

The best way to relieve this sensation is to first undergo physical therapy to try and release the compressive forces through activity, massage, etc. Then, there are medications that can lessen the pain. Finally, if none of those methods relieves your symptoms it is possible that surgery can be performed, however, this is dependent upon how severe the canal stenosis is and how long the stenotic portion is since it is too long the surgery may produce worse pain symptoms during recovery than what you already have. It is a dilemma to be sure. But just attack it step by step. Save surgery for last in my opinion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Is there anything I can do to avoid going into a gynecologist personally? I really wish I would not have to go to a doctor personally.", "output": "Hi. Thanks for the query. According to your description the lump you mentioned could be bartholin cyst as you are thinking. Usually it occurs due to the blockage of bartholin duct. Small cyst may not cause any problem but when a size increases or the cyst gets infected that can lead to formation of abscess, in that case you may experience pain and discomfort. As per as possible better to get examined by your gynecologist to find out the actual nature of the cyst. Sometimes antibiotics are sufficient to decrease the size of the cyst. If it gets infected and increases in size you may need to go for minor surgical procedures like incision and Drainage or Marsupialization. If you want relief now before going to your doctor you can take sitz bath with lukewarm water and 10 to 15 ml of Betadine solution, twice a day with 10 minutes duration.

I am afraid that something is wrong with my heart. Yesterday, we were driving back from a trip, and my left lower jaw had intermittent pain, which was radiating to my arm. The pain was on and off for about half the day. Today, my entire jaw, forehead, neck, and upper back are sore. It scares me that it is heart-related.

Jaw pain that is caused by cardiovascular problems is usually associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, etc. Your symptoms are caused by the TMJ temporomandibular joint, and I suggest you take a painkiller, like tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg, two tablets, three times a day for five days.

{"context": "How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine?", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

First of all do not panic. As you have history of irregular cycles, please get USG done to rule out PCOS  polycystic ovaries. As you might be aware that PCOS is a lifestyle disorder, and it can be corrected by following a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Secondly, please get your boyfriends semen analysis done to know about the quality and quantity of sperms. I will suggest you to get post menstrual HSG  hysterosalpingography done, to know bout tubal patency. With these reports in normal range, you can get ovulation study on USG done from day 10 of the cycle. This will help you to know about the day of ovulation. You can simply opt for unprotected sex on and around the day of ovulation. or else you can opt for IUI  intrauterine insemination, on the day of ovulation. This will help to get pregnant.

My question is whether it comes under safe days or not. If not, what to do for protected sex?", "output": "You are right in contemplating the fact that tomorrow she will be on her day 19 of her cycle, which is her unsafe period if her menses have been regular, so chances of pregnancy with unprotected intercourse would definitely be higher. So, the best way to have protection would still be barrier contraception with condoms with additional use of spermicidal jelly over it to reduce the chances of failure due to rupture condoms during intercourse. Also, practice ejaculation outside the vagina, that would further reduce the chances of any misadventure. The second method is to ask her to use a cervical diaphragm, which is a female condom and needs to be inserted before intercourse and removed post intercourse along with you using barrier contraception. The failure rate of condoms is 3.3 percent which can be increased by either using double condoms with or without spermicidal jelly or with a female condom."}

I saw the report you have attached attachments removed to protect the patients identity. You have Hemoglobin Hb value just less than the standard lower limit. Your Ferritin and MCV mean corpuscular volume value are low. Combining all these indicates iron deficiency anemia. In IDA Iron deficiency anemia, Serum Ferritin is the earliest parameter to decrease. Ferritin indicates iron stored in our bodies. You have high Platelet and Pct procalcitonin value. Platelet count above 450000 is called thrombocytosis. It could be primary or secondary thrombocytosis. Anemia and infection are reasons to cause an increase in platelet or reactive thrombocytosis. Increased monocytes indicate some viral infection, most probably. So overall, the finding I could guide you is that there is iron deficiency anemia which could be one reason for increased platelet count in your blood. Before treating IDA, the cause should be investigated, whether it is nutritional or other. I would suggest an ironrich diet. Also, ask your treating physician to add oral iron tablets.

After using the tablets I am getting periods within 27 to 32 days. My periods are due. Still, I did not get periods. Should I take home a pregnancy test or should I wait for some more days?", "output": "How are you doing? You can test a home pregnancy test, with an early morning first sample of urine. If doubtful, have blood serum beta hCG human chorionic gonadotropin to confirm pregnancy. Urine is positive even one day after a missed period. These delayed periods can be due to PCOD polycystic ovarian syndrome. If still negative, it means you are not pregnant, then to get periods, have any of the birth control pills or contraceptive pills like tablet Novelon, OvralG, DuolutonL, Dear 21, or Intimacy plus 3  one tablet twice a day for 10 days throw away the 21st pill no matter what the cause is except pregnancy. You will get periods within seven to ten days. If I may advise, no one gets pregnant just by having those pills. Those pills Myoinositol and DChiro inositol are thought to cause a fall in insulin resistance. But this is treating the symptom of PCOD, not the disease PCOD itself. So even if you get pregnant with PCOD untreated, you will need a lot of hormone support, and have a risk of early pregnancy bleeding and abortion. Let me give you a few facts about PCOD and what can be done. PCOD  Polycystic ovaries, This is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed condition, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone if I may simulate you may have seen obese men developing breast and in young obese girls, who develop periods at a younger age. They all have high levels of estrogen hormone or female hormone. In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to the hormone which tips the balance between FSH from the brain  and the ovarian hormone. FSH folliclestimulating hormone  as the name suggests stimulates follicles from the ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain gets confused and follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size and will not rupture. Next scan you will see all these follicles as polycystic ovaries. This is usually associated with obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for a few months, and later heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, spotting on and off. Thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra pad of fat around the midsegment of the body, especially the waist, thighs, and breasts, with no fat beyond the elbow and knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over the lower half of the face, acne, oily face skin, black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs, and under the surface of the breast. May have a family history of diabetes, especially father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at any time and so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution. Your weight has to be weight in kg Height in cms100. Once you reduce weight to the normal range, you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and your pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight do not fast, avoid eating junk food or red meat, and reduce snacks in between meals. Have low calories food, high proteins regular exercise especially for the waist and hip area, aerobics, yoga, brisk walking swing your hands well, and try to reduce two to four kilograms per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kgs, you will see changes. Even if you are in the normal weight range, try this schedule, it will help PCOD itself may not be the cause, but what if you missed some other cause, as four years is a long time? Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is done. For your husband do semen analysis at least two done four weeks apart preferably in an infertility center examination done by an andrologist and also check blood sugar levels. For you, check blood sugars, thyroid profile, and ultrasound scans to evaluate the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Confirm tubal patency which is most important Tube is the connection between the uterus and ovaries the bridge where sperm meets the egg and forms a baby. This is the size of the hair follicle and cannot be seen on scans. Being such a small opening tube can get blocked easily, So check with HSGXray with dye, SSG scan with dye, or laparoscopy."}

The battery of modern pacemakers can last from 5 to 10 years, but older models have batteries that last less time. When the battery is low, you must replace the pacemaker generator. And this could be a cause of low blood pressure.If your husband has severe heart failure, it can also be a cause for low levels of blood pressure. In this situation, we must optimize the specific therapeutic to this problem. Moreover, in this situation, also the use of medications to raise the pressure can be deleterious to the patient.Therefore, before seeking a remedy to increase pressure levels of her husband, it is necessary to exhaust efforts to identify the causes of low pressure.

I also took a home pregnancy kit test four days ago, which showed a negative result. I am tense. Why do I have this?", "output": "It is possible that the light brown discharge you are experiencing could be related to the emergency contraceptive pill you took a week ago. Emergency contraception can cause changes in your menstrual cycle, including irregular bleeding or spotting. It is also possible that the brown discharge could be implantation bleeding, which can sometimes occur when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. Since you took a home pregnancy test four days ago and showed a negative result, it is less likely that you are pregnant, but it is still possible. Home pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken after a missed period, so it may be a good idea to take another test in a few days or to schedule an appointment with your gynecologist for a blood test, which can detect pregnancy earlier than a home test. It is important to keep in mind that stress and other factors can also affect your menstrual cycle and cause changes in discharge. Regards."}

Since I first started menstruating, I have always been heavy and longer than average. My normal periods last for 8-10 days, and I use typically 1.5 complete boxes of tampons during a cycle. I am in a long term relationship and have only had this singular sexual partner since 2017. I am not on birth control of any means and in some cases, I have had to use emergency contraceptives post intercourse. In the past two months, I have used contraceptives twice, once in the end of March, and most recently about two weeks ago. Since then, and this is the first time experiencing this, I have had dark brown, clumpy discharge, the closest comparison would be like damp coffee grounds. Within the past week, I had also gotten a thing flesh-toned or white clot with blood on it, about 2.5 inches in length. I am started to feel concerned as the discharge has not stopped and I believe that is occurring rather than a menstrual cycle, at the time I am writing this I should have had my period cycle now, but instead, I have this dark brown discharge. At this time, I fear the idea of going to a doctor\u2019s office for the safety of myself during this pandemic but also do not want to prolong any critical issues I may be facing. I have taken photographed images of all of this in worry that the typed description does not come across correctly. Please help.", "output": "Hi. Do not be stressed, I am here to help. According to your history, you have not got periods this month and you are having some abnormal discharge. . My first suggestion would be to do get a urine pregnancy test. I understand that you have used emergency contraceptive but sometimes it fails. We need to know whether you have a pregnancy in which cases sometime the discharge is of nature as you described. You may be in the process of a miscarriage. If this is negative, then the next step would be to get a pelvic ultrasound done because the discharge seems unusual. But let me assure you that there are more chances of you having a miscarriage due to the failure of emergency contraceptives. In case your urine pregnancy test is positive you need to take proper treatment like pregnancy termination kits or Misoprostol tablets depending on the condition of the conceptus baby at this time. In case your pregnancy test is negative you need a pap smear, ultrasound, and sos biopsy of the tissue you are discharging. Whatever it is, it can be managed properly if it is addressed on time. There is no need for panic. Please follow up with your pregnancy test results. I hope this helps. Failure of emergency contraception. Pregnancy test. Endometrial hyperplasia. According to the test results."}

You should go for a laparoscopy to confirm that the tubes are blocked. Sometimes HSG can be incorrect also. So, if tubes are blocked even on laparoscopy, and it is a proximal block, cannulation can be tried to open the tubes. If it cant be opened, you have to go through IVF to conceive.

Hence, if you want to consume these pills for induction of ovulation, you should take them before intrauterine semen instillation IUI  Injecting the sperms. The protocol should be as follows From day 2 of the cycle, Clomiphene citrate tablets are taken for 5 days. Then from day 9 onwards, monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography. When the ovulation takes place, semen should go in your uterus either naturally by intercourse or by IUI. Occasionally, the ovulation fails in spite of these tablets. In such cases, when the follicle is about 18 mm to 21 mm size, Inj. hCG is given to induce the ovulation and then the semen is injected.

Do I request another hida scan to see if polyps inside gallbladder is growing? Please advise. Thanks.", "output": "If you are having symptoms similar to agallstone attack with severe right upper quadrant abdominalpain, nausea, vomiting etc , the scan would be abnormal.For polyps or stones , ultrasound examination is more sensitive.But if the size of the polyp or stone is less than one centimeterin size , it may not show up well on ultrasound.Typical gallbladder pain may radiate to the right shoulder or theright upper back and usually this is not constant, more likespasms. From the numbers thhat you have given , you seem tohave abnormal gallbladder function. This may be associated withabnormal sphincter called the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.If that is the case , gallbladder removal will help. Remember , yourliver continues to make bile and it comes to the intestinedirectly since the gallbladder which acts as a storage organ is nolonger there.If your back problem id due to disc problems of the spine you mayhave to that evaluated by an orthopedic doctor or a neurologyspecialist.I wish you the very best."}

She will be sleeping peacefully and all of a sudden jump out of her arms and legs in the air and screams and cries until she is blue in the face. Also, while she is sleeping or napping she grunts and makes very strange noises.

Due to abnormal neck position and pain, she may find it difficult to see around. Please continue physiotherapy and follow her and if the pain is more you can give Paracetamol for pain relief. Make symptoms diary and take videos of the event which may help the pediatrician to look for any problem. The way she is screaming suddenly it is possible that it is startle reflex.

Is my condition now contagious even its minimal?", "output": "i can understand your concern. upper lobe lung lesions can be due to tuberculosis or pneumonia. treatment of tuberculosis is for at least 6 months. and treatment for pneumonia is for 1014 days. so it is better to get done repeat chest xray after 14 days of antibiotic treatment. if you are having simple pneumonia than it will be cleared in new xray. but if it is tuberculosis then it will not clear. this is the reason why pulmonologist called you after 14 days with fresh chest xray. so get done repeat chest xray after 14 days. you may also need bronchoscopic evaluation to rule out tuberculosis. hope i have solved your query. wish you good health."}

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.", "output": "I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."}

{"context": "Have abdominal pain, spastic colitis, cold sores, no discharge. Had hysterectomy. Is it the same diverticulitis?", "input": "I am a 52-year-old woman, 155 pounds, 5 7 , and I have several health issues, but one that remains a mystery, and that is extremely uncomfortable, is the discomfort I have in my upper abdomen when I exert myself. This is a sensation of extreme pressure in the area of my diaphragm, like I am having the wind knocked out of me, and is most extreme when I am climbing stairs or doing anything that elevates my heart rate. I can no longer do aerobic activity because of it, and I would like to be able to work my body, but this condition won t allow it. This sensation occurs right in the middle, just underneath my ribs. It feels like my stomach has been replaced with a brick--it feels weighty. I also get mildly nauseated, and it doesn t matter if I have eaten or not. It happens on an empty stomach as much as it does on a full stomach. It feels as if I ve eaten a huge meal and can t catch my breath, even if I haven t. There is also pain that I would rate anywhere between a 3 and a 6. The pain can also extend to closer to where the pancreas is, and while I have had a few cases of acute pancreatitis in the past, my blood work has not shown to be positive for it since 1996. The other mysterious thing that nobody seems to have an answer to is that I wake up in the morning with a thin lower torso, but I put a few inches on in fluid throughout the day. This is not ascites - it is all in the tissue, under the skin, surrounding my abdomen and back. This has happened every single day for the last five years, and is also worse upon exertion. High temperature can bring it on and exacerbate it too. It s so frustrating, and I have been called a hypochondriac numerous times. I was even yelled at by an ER physician when I went in with extreme PACs and a combo of bradycardia & tachycardia that wouldn t abate - something that occurs a few times a year and that makes me have to go into the ER for i.v. Lopressor. These are the things I know for sure (and I ve been tested for many, many things). I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, Ptosis (which is worse first thing in the morning but usually goes away after time), and I sometimes get these little painful blisters on my upper abdomen, under breasts, on my knees and elbows. They are red and full of liquid and very painful. They last just one or two days, and then they are little painful scabs. They flare up fairly often - usually I get them once or twice a month. Cholesterol is 240 (I ve brought it down from 283 with diet change and fish oil). I have some connective tissue issues (hypermobility and possibly Ehlers Danlos, which my daughter was diagnosed with too) and possibly Sjogren s Syndrome (Schirmer test result is 0 and I get frequent salivary gland pain and swelling, very dry mouth, and several other symptoms) although ANA tests are negative. I had a spot removed from my chest which was positive for Lupus, however, a subsequent biopsy on normal skin from the same area was negative. I also have frequent inflammation of the medial epicondyle and it s quite painful, and painful swelling in other joints. Tests for inflammation are also negative but I was diagnosed with arthritis. I have, what a couple doctors have called Myotonia, but others dispute it. When I squeeze my hand tightly for several seconds, then relax, my fingers stay gripped. They will relax over time, or I can open them with my other hand. The doctor who diagnosed it was a primary care physician, and she observed my daughter and I both showing her, and she used the little hammer and tapped on the muscle near my thumb, which caused the thumb to cramp up. However, muscle testing was negative. I get a combination of PACs, bradycardia, and tachycardia, that leaves me unable to function because I have near-syncope when it happens. I have had three major episodes in the last twelve months or so that required ER trips and i.v. Lopressor to fix it. The first time it happened that extreme was in February of 2012 and I ve had three like that since. They don t know why it happens, but I ve had heart rhythm issues for years. An ablation didn t fix it. I have frequent flare-ups that leave me unable to perform daily tasks or work on a regular basis so I have had to go on disability, which I hate. I would like to have my life back. I would also like to find a doctor who can help me figure out this mystery, which has robbed me of so much time. I can t do the things I used to do and I am kind of afraid of the daily edema, which is uncomfortable in itself. I want to find a doctor who will not look at me like I m a freak who is making it all up. I m not. Here are some pictures of the edema in my torso. You can also see pictures of the Ptosis and blisters if you go up to the top and click on the heading. WWW.WWWW.WW", "output": "Hi maam,Thanks for your query.I have gone through your detailed query very thoroughly.I am of the strong conviction that you are indeed suffering from MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY, since majority of your problems fit into this condition. I will try to solve most of your problems, if not all.Firstly, the heaviness in the center of chest and upper abdomen with minimal exertions swelling of the lower torso during the day, is STRONGLY suggestive of failing of the entire heart along with coexisting coronary artery disease. Investigations like 2D Echo, stress TMTThallium test and coronary angiography will confirm my views. Medicines like digoxin, diuretics, lowdose alphabeta blockers such as carvedilol, coronary vasodilators in adequate doses and ACE inhibitors in titrated doses will certainly help you.Further, the tachycardiabradycardia syndrome also called Sick Sinus Syndrome, which is part of the manifestations of Myotonic dystrophy can be kept under control on antiarrhythmic drug, such as, amiodarone and, ideally a dual chamber pacemaker.Difficulty in opening fingers after sustained squeezing of fingers, as well as, transient ptosis drooping of the eyelids, is also part of the symptoms of Myotonic Dystrophy. Perhaps, serum Potassium estimation should be periodically.Since the disease primarily affects the muscles, the intestinal smooth muscles too tend to get involved, leading to bloating, constipation, poor digestion. Perhaps, prokinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide  omeprazole will be of some help.For osteoporosis, adequate calcium  Vit D3 1000mcg daily intake will of significant benefit.Lastly, may I inform you that it is a genetic disease and has NO TREATMENT. Only symptomatic treatment can be given to relieve different problems associated with the condition.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinionrecommendations and treatment. I am certain that he will agree with my opinion and clinical acumen order required tests, and based on the reports will prescribe suitable treatment as advised.

If the results indicate increased pus cell count, it could indicate a bacterial infection and could require to be treated with antibiotics like Ofloxacin. But in case pus cell count is normal, there is no need to give antibiotics and there is less to worry about.

Back in November of 2015, I started awaking to a yellowish fluid in my bra. After about a week, I discovered that the fluid was coming from my right breast. I felt around my breast and discovered a small lump. I went to the doctor who, because of my age of 28, wrote it off as a fibroadenoma. I left it alone. I left the country for a few months, and in South Africa the leakage came back worse than before, so I went back again to the doctor. She had a ultrasound done and revealed that I not only had a Fribroadenoma, but also a Intraductal Papilloma, which would explain my leakage. That was back in March of this year. Over the months the lumps have gotten bigger, they hurt constantly, at least twice a day, and i feel three prominent new lumps that have developed beneath my right breast. I have not had a new ultrasound or mammogram done due to lack of funds. I have had blood work done within the last week and they all reveal nothing to be wrong. Not only am I in pain from my breasts, yes the left one hurts as well just no lumps found yet although a tiny one is popping up in the middle of my chest bone. I am also having serious body aches.

I need medical attention, I can't eat, sleep, or drink, I feel like I have something lodged in my throat and every time I try to eat or drink I feel sick. I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks, I'm below 110 lbs now. I also have dental problems, it hurts to chew, I have to use my tongue and the roof of my mouth. I can't take any meds because I fear of how they will make me feel. What can I do? Are there any doctors willing to come to my home?", "output": "You have symptoms of agoraphobia and cant leave home. You have feeling that something lodged in your throat which is most likely due to anxiety. This is causing significant impairment which has resulted in loss of significant weight. Agoraphobia can be treated easily. Most of medicines used also help in generalised anxiety. Medicines like SSRIs as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline etc are commonly used in anxiety and agoraphobia.

Systematic desensitisation also help in early recovery.Thanks, hope this helps you."}

This time it came after 40 days with a spot of bleeding and no bleeding for three days after which normal bleeding has lasted for around eight days making it a total eleven days. This has never happened before and is worrying. Should we take this as some of the instance and continue monitoring or should we do some doctor followup? She had a uterus scan some five months back which was normal and a cervical smear test to evaluate cancer risk which was normal as well.", "output": "This episode of delayed and heavy bleeding might have been due to one of the two reasons. Delayed or absent ovulation. It is normal to have occasional cycle anovulatory and in such a case period will be delayed and heavy. If this is the case, there should be no need to worry as such an episode will not recur frequently. She might have been pregnant and it was early abortion and so heavy bleeding. Condom, used for contraception has a high failure rate and it is better to use some better contraception like oral pills or CuT copper T. If bleeding has stopped completely, again, there should be no reason to worry. You can confirm whether she was pregnant by doing a simple urine pregnancy test. If it comes positive, you need to consult a gynecologist once for further management. Repeat the ultrasound if such episodes recur."}

After reviewing your report , if you do not have any symptoms of hypothyroidism like dry skin, hair loss, cold intolerance, weight gain, loss of appetite, or bradycardia, you can be diagnosed as having subclinical hypothyroidism for which your physician will find no need to start you on any treatment. Because subclinical hypothyroidism is usually started on treatment only in special patients like a pregnant woman, and not usually in a general population. If your physician has any further doubts after examining you, he may advise you to get antiTPO thyroperoxidase antibodies test and thyroid scan to rule out any remote causes to be started for treatment. I advise you to get a repeat thyroid profile testing done after three months or in between in case you develop any symptoms."}

{"context": "How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine?", "input": "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.", "output": "There are few researchesstudies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette tobacco. So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels vasoconstriction. It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissuesor sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces shortlived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes longterm damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its halflife is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with longterm use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 1248 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs side effects itself. Best of luck."}

Thanks", "output": "to be on safer side i would advise you to get your son vaccinated again. but it depends on the severity of wound. if it is just minor abrasions then just 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day is enough. if the wound is severe or in sites like head, face, neck etc. then the entire course should be repeated. some doctors may suggest just a tetanus injection, and ask you to watch the dog for ten days. if there are any signs of madness in the dog in the course of ten days then report immediately and get vaccinated. otherwise, just a tetanus is enough. this may be the view of some doctors in case you are very sure that the pet dog doe snot have symptoms of rabies and its vaccinated. but still there is a minor chance of risk. why to take even the slightest risk? because once if a person contracts rabies then mortality is 100.hence, you can contact a physician and let him assess the severity of wound and in case it is a minor wound just ask your son to take 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day. though the immunity lasts for 2 to 10 years but still it is advisable to take booster dose of rabies irrespective of the interval between the previous full course of vaccination, because we dont want to take risk with rabies. hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. ill be glad to help you."}

Cuts are healed quick quickly.I am wondering if I do symptoms of being diabetic.Many thanks.Danny LAU", "output": "Some patients with diabetes have no symptoms at all and some with symptoms pointing towards diabetes may have normal sugars. That is why we clinicians rely on blood sugar values alone for diagnosing someone with diabetes. So the symptoms of feeling thirsty too often drinking lots of juices and itchy dry skin and tingling in the toes can point towards diabetes. I would suggest you to get a blood test for the following tests 1 Fasting blood glucose2 Post meal blood glucose after 2 hours3 HbA1c4 Renal function tests5 Liver function tests6 TSH7 Vit B12 levelsThese test results will guide us to tell whether the reason for your symptoms is diabetes or something else.

I am diagnosed as schizophrenia, borderline intellectual function, auditory hallucinations, hyperacusis in both ears, transient alternative of awareness (EEG). My MRI is normal.", "output": "If you have auditory hallucinations regularly then the dose of Risperdal Risperidone or Abilify Aripiprazole needs to be increased so that these can be controlled or you have to change to other drug like Clozapine can be tried. Clozapine is a reserved drug for treatment resistant schizophrenia. Intellectual functions cannot be increased but regular training can help. Similarly, hyperacusis cannot be usually treated but with the help of counseling and acoustic therapy, the anxiety and discomfort caused by it can be modulated. I hope this helps. Talk to your psychiatrist regarding the change of drug dose or starting on Clozapine."}

{"context": "I am almost three months late for my period and weight reduction did not help. Why?", "input": "Hello doctor, I am 19 years old. I am almost three months late for my period and do not know what to do. I read some articles and found out that weight loss triggers periods and I have lost around 50 pounds in the last year, bringing my weight down to 122 pounds. I am super scared about my periods. Also, this morning I had white discharge, can that be a sign of my period may be coming?", "output": "Yes, excess weight does cause a hormonal disturbance that can lead to delayed periods. But there can be other hormonal changes like thyroid and prolactin that need to be evaluated to look for the cause of the delayed periods. Sometimes stress also can cause a delay. And yes, the consistency of the discharge can be a little thicker during the premenstrual phase if ovulation happens, but we cannot predict just based on that if you would be getting your periods or not. If already three months have lapsed, and if there is no chance for a pregnancy, then it would be advisable to take medication for withdrawal and get yourself evaluated for the irregular menstrual cycle issues. I hope this helps."}

Do not worry. it is physiological. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastrocolic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands  then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastrocolic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.Even if the kid is vomiting after feeds if his activity and development is age appropriate you need not worry.

Too much and too sudden an increase in thyronorm may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism including increased heart rate sinus tachycardia which leads to increase in blood pressure. Thyronorm needs to be taken consistently daily, preferably on an empty stomach in the morning around the same time each day. If a drug is designed to be taken every 24 hours and the patient takes it every 48 hours, that means the drug will lose its effectiveness after 24 hours. The drug level in the blood will drop below therapeutic level, and once the patient takes the medication 48 hours later, the body will overcompensate for the sudden increase in dose and symptoms of hyperthyroidism will develop.

{"context": "How can I correct my eye ogling while talking to someone?", "input": "During childhood days I was a bit introvert but used to enjoy a lot by playing all sorts of indoor and outdoor games apart from studying. During college days also no issues were there as such. But while joined in a metro city as my first job felt bit awkward that I was not able to mingle with all people in my colony. I used to avoid social activity a bit. After that posted in a remote area where stayed for five years and enjoyed a lot mixing and partying with all sort of people. Then I was posted to my home place where one influential boss wanted to keep me in his section but due to pressure from higher up he had to give up his idea, but directly or indirectly he was harsh. That was the beginning I feel. Along with that during that posting, I used to travel a lot, worked almost day and night just for my good name, that people will appreciate. Got lots of appreciation but these process initiate. During initial days after few hours of conversation people used to know about my eye ogling issue but now I feel within few minutes they can make out.  I want to change it at any cost. Sometimes doing exercise, yoga but not so regular. My sleeping is very good, after going to bed, within a few seconds I used to sleep. Previously during any stomach ache, hand pain, headache for any reason, I used to think I will die very soon for that cause. What will happen to my family and so on. Although in my family, my wife has a good job and have only one child. But during last few months, much of change was going on in a positive way. During any farewell or any party if any photography will be there then my face will be in very much in tension. So nowadays during the photography session, I am avoiding that and instead, take photographs of all. Slowly and steadily I want to change eye ogling issue. My eye ogling look is like someone is surprised to see something strange. I know I can change but an efficient or proper support is needed. Never taken any medication. For blood pressure taken Repace 25 initially two years back. From mid of last year taken Repace 50. And later started taking CTD T 6.25/40. Felt many a time to stop this CTD T due to no such tension except eye ogling.", "output": "Tension or stress is different from hypertension or high blood pressure. BP blood pressure medications will not help with the psychological tension you are describing. Social avoidance is another problem you have described. You are mostly disturbed about a preoccupation with eye ogling. And you have had panic related to normal bodily symptoms like stomach ache, headache, and hand pain. I think you are having anxiety issues. Consulting a psychiatrist would be my advice. I would suggest taking tablet Nexito 5 mg once a day after breakfast. It starts to have an effect on anxiety and social avoidance after at least 15 days of taking it. There are no side effects in the long term but in the initial two weeks, you may experience gastric trouble or bloat and initially increased anxiety. If they happen, start with a half tablet of Nexito 5 mg. You might need a prescription for this medication."}

More than this it should not be there. The next possibility I think of is a bug bite allergy. The other possibility is a cellulitis or a skin infection.

{"context": "Suggest treatment for severe foot pain", "input": "My arm suddenly went numb and when I tried to move it it worked but it felt like someone else was moving it. I could only tell it moved by watching it. Then the speed slowed down and I could barely move it at all. It was cold when it hit my other hand. Then my chest started to burn and my other arm started going numb. And everything started getting farther away as the numbness crept over my entire body. I hoped it was restricted blood flow from my previous wrist surgery. Because it started with that arm. I tried hard and jerked my right shoulder around. Hoping it would jar the senses like when your foot falls asleep. I could barely feel it but that s more than I had prior so I did it again. Then I sat on the bed and everything came back to me. I am a 21 year old female and I was not drinking or doing drugs. I had just woke up and had cooked food and drink and went to my room to eat. I am also a smoker, 5 4 weighing 104. I mention because it could be of importance. Please help it scared me. It s happened before about 8 months ago but not as severe. Simply numbness and far away and watching my body move", "output": "Hi,Thanks for your query.Numbness in the arms indicate that there is some sort of neurological disturbance impaired conduction of nerve impulse in the involved nerves. This may result due to compression of the nerve at some level during its course or may also result due to some systemic diseases. A detailed clinical examination and few investigations like EMG  Nerve conduction studies are needed to establish a correct diagnosis of your problem. I suggest you to consult a Neurophysician and follow the advice.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"}
{"context": "Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?", "input": "Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.", "output": "I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."}

I have no pain associated with the flutters, but I obviously have concerns that there is an underlying issue. Is this normal? Obviously when I have the flutters it automatically kicks in my anxiety. Please help.", "output": "i carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern. but you should not worry. these fluttering sensation have to do with some electrical issues in the heart. some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm cause a premature heart contraction that you feel like a fluttering or skipped beat, because its not a normal one. these electrical issues might be different to simple sinus tachycardia, meaning frequency above 100beatminute to extrasistolic beats or other arrhythmia. the extrasistolic beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. a sinus tachycardia means regular normal rhythm with high frequency that gives you the sensation like fluttering. if the rhythm is fast and chaotic than we are dealing with an arrhythmia like fibrillation ctif this fluttering are not frequent, in young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about. it is quite known in medicine that anxiety, stress disorders might cause rhythm problems, so you have to mnage them. pathology like anemia or hyperthyroidism might be other causes. so, if i was your treating doctor i would say that you have nothing to worry if this happens once a wile, its normal, and we will try to deal with your stress disorder. but if they begin to bother you and interfere in your live, and as you say they trigger your anxiety we can decide to do some examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm and the extrasistolik beat frequencies if any. only than we can decide what we should do and if it is necessary to treat them medically. hope i was helpful."}

After initial disappointment settles down, they will support you. Learn to develop coping strategies to manage frustrations. You will come out stronger in the long term. Try to distract yourself and relax for some days. Then plan to retake the exam with better preparation. Make sure you eat well, sleep regularly, listen to relaxing music, talk to supportive friends and family.

{"context": "What cause sudden vibration from the leg to chest?", "input": "I am a mom of a son who has TS. I am taking a class where I am profiling him as a case study. In the early years of his TS (he is 23, was 9 at onset), he was treated with clonidine for his nuisance verbal and motor tics Can you please give me the indication and MOA for that medication choice? Thank you! Sorry, I didn t know it cost money for the answer. Can t afford it. Thanks", "output": "Thanks for query Several studies have shown that Clonidine, an  2adrenoceptor agonist, is effective in relieving tics, and the mechanism of action is thought to be linked to clonidines effect on inhibitory effect resulting from reduced noradrenergic activity.Tourette Syndrome affects around one child in every 100 and usually begins in early childhood. During adolescence, there is a period of pruning back in which redundant brain connections are removed and other structural and functional brain changes occur.During this time, around onethird of children with Tourette Syndrome will find that their tics disappear and another third are able to more effectively control their tics. The remaining third, however, will experience little or no change in their tics and are likely to remain troubled by their Tourette Syndrome symptoms into adulthood.This phenomenon suggests that there are mechanisms in the brain that are involved in controlling tics and undergo development or reorganization in the teen years.So clonidine has a good role in TS , ADHD and sleep onset disorder."}

You have received medications for bacterial infection but it keeps coming back. One thing that I want to tell you is that in normal females few have high vaginal secretions. It is sometimes by genetics or otherwise at ovulation or excitement, at fertilization or in stress or anxiety or overexertion during pregnancy or in a few diabetic patients. All can be due to overproduction of normal vaginal flora as well but other infections could be there. You could have one of the abovementioned causes. Do not overtreat vaginal secretions unless it is diagnosed infection, smelly, irritating and not normal as it can cause damage to your normal vaginal flora that is lactobacillus. As a result, you can have vaginal dryness, oversecretion from the vagina. Maintain strict hygiene. Soft comfortable undergarments. Have a healthy nutritious diet and try to have full monitoring and treatment, if you have any health problem. Have twice on two alternate days Clotrimazole pessary per vaginal and have one course of tablet Doxycycline 100 mg BID for seven days.

{"context": "How can parents keep their children safe around water this summer?", "input": "Hello doctor, What do parents need to know about keeping their children safe around water this summer? How to stay safe at a pool (in the water and around the pool area)? How to stay safe at a beach (in the water and on the shore)? What are possible signs of distress or danger parents should look for (extreme exhaustion, coughing, heavy breathing)? What is dry drowning and what to look for? Most important points parents should teach their kids about water safety.", "output": "1. Staying safe in and around the pool Avoid taking children between the age of 6 months to 4 years near pools as they may go unnoticed into the pool and may drown. If at all you do take children to the pools make sure they have their floats and other safety equipment on at all times even when out of the pool. Make sure children do not drink the water of the pool. 2. Staying safe in and around a beach All of the above tips plus be careful of children eating sand. Watch out for sea urchins, crabs and insects that may bite the children. Carry enough water with you and advice the children to drink plenty of water so as to prevent dehydration on a hot sunny day at the beach. 3. Warning signs Breathlessness, fainting, drowsiness, convulsion. 4. Dry drowning is when water enters the childs nose and upper respiratory airway but does not enter the lungs due to spasm of the upper respiratory tract. Watch out for breathlessness, chest pain and irritability in this case."}

My doctors office just called me and told me that they forgot to review lab work with me from April saying I was Anemic. Is it possible that being Anemic in such a high risk pregnancy with out treatment could have caused me to have liver problems which forced me to deliver so early?", "output": "Hi,The liver problem that you have described seems to be due to increase in bile acids, which is a condition unique to pregnancy. It causes itching without rash and is relieved once delivery occurs. Anemia can cause increased risk of post delivery bleeding, need of blood transfusion during delivery or later, but would not be a reason for liver problems.Twins pregnancies are known to have an increased risk of complications, and also early delivery due to a variety of reasons both maternal and fetal.The high blood pressure, and the itchingobstetric cholestasis could be the cause.For the anemia, I would advise you to take iron supplements and get your haemoglobin checked again after 1 months time.Hope this helps.Regards."}

It can be due to anything you came in contact with, may be a plant, or any other thing else.You seem to have been rubbing due to itching.

He also has seasonal pollen allergies, triggering asthma symptoms, including wheezing (when he was very young). He used a nebulizer until first or second grade (six to seven years old) and has not needed one since. He still has seasonal allergies, but his wheezing has subsided to almost nonexistent. However, now at the age of 16, his pediatrician asked me if he was allergic to anything during his last routine physical. I answered tree nuts. He added that to his blood workup, which came back with high levels of hazelnut, walnut, and pecan. We have gone to the same pediatrician for the last 16 years and never changed. With that report, his doctor wants to prescribe an EpiPen. It is not only expensive; it is overkill. Is it essential? Please offer some objective advice on this case. .", "output": "EpiPen epinephrine is essential in case of emergency, only if the allergic reaction is very severe. For those with a wellknown allergy history, it is best to carry the EpiPen with them all the time because you do not know when they will have the next attack. So I agree with the physician who prescribed the EpiPen. I suggest using it in case of emergency only. Please do not hesitate to follow up for further advice about allergic reactions and emergencies.

It was supposed to be an outpatient surgery however it took much longer than it was supposed to because of the bleeding and cutting involved.  Today I had another Cystoscopy and he saw a growth that requires it to be removed again.  Why wouldnt a 2nd Cystoscopy be performed prior to the treatments to insure that all Cancer was removed visually at least prior to wasting 6 weeks of BCG treatment only to discover growth?

Kindly suggest the treatment.", "output": "I read your query, and from what information you have given me, it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the midparental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper workup to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF1 insluingrowth fractor and IGFBP3 insulinlike growth fractor binding protein. 3. LH leutinizing hormone and FSH follicle stimulating hormone routine tests like CBC complete blood count, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation arte. 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test. 6. Urinalysis, and Xray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary. So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now.

Growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects. I hope my advice is of some benefit to you."}
{"context": "Will swallowing of dologel ct gel by a 5 year cause any problems?", "input": "My 18 month has a red dot in the white of her eye - doesn't seem to be bothered by it and no other symptons but I don't know if it could be something to worry about it? Do you know what causes this and if she should see a doctor? Will the red dot go away on its own?", "output": "I am pleasure to answer your question. The red spot you see is most likely a small blood vessel. In medical terms, it is called a subconjuntival hemmorhage. Small blood vessels lie underneath the conjunctiva, the clear coating that covers the sclera, the white part of the eye. But most often feel no pain, irritation or light sensitivity.A subconjunctival hemmorhage can occur if a person has too much pressure on the upper part of the body or head. Pressure can be created by straining too hard while lifting something very heavy or coughing or sneezing. Straining during constipation can also cause enough pressure to burst a blood vessel in the eye. Other causes are high blood pressure, diabetes, trauma or a high dosage of blood thinners, such as aspirin.If a red spot in your eye lasts for longer than a few days, you should schedule an eye exam. Your eye doctor will try to determine the cause of the subconjunctival hemmorhage.Hope it is helpful."}

{"context": "Is there a link between loss of appetite and depression?", "input": "I am on psychiatric medication since two to three years, but found no improvement. I have started exercise such as walking, yoga and pranayama and found some relief. I become depressed more when I read about depression on internet. My main issue now is loss of appetite, headache when free or anxious and anxiety due to loss of appetite. Are these due to major depression or minor depression? I am taking Megapose plus one pill at bedtime. I was very happy and loss of appetite also had cured at certain level, but when I read in internet that major depression cannot be cured by exercise, I become more depressed and problems again aroused. Please advise me about exercise for major depression. Can exercise cure major depression? I am consuming whisky three pegs daily and I am having tobacco chewing habit. I cannot sleep without drinking alcohol. I want to withdraw drinking, but due to sleep problem I am unable to stop. I am suffering from stomach gas, loose motions and also constipation. I have attached my past medication prescriptions.", "output": "Loss of appetite is a blanket symptom which can be present in any of the psychiatric illness including depression. In major depressive disorder, loss of appetite is associated with sadness of mood, decreased energy level, easy fatigability, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, inability to enjoy pleasurable activities, decreased sleep, negative ideas about self or world or future and loss of libido. If these symptoms are also present along with loss of appetite, then only it can be concluded that you are having major depressive disorder. Megapose combination of Flupenthixol and Melitracen is not the treatment of choice for depressive episode. If you have any one of the above then you need to be started on either of the following drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRIs or serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor SNRI or norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitor NDRIs and serotonin partial agonist and reuptake inhibitor SPARI with the consent of your specialist doctor. Besides this, your habit of alcohol consumption and tobacco chewing is majorly contributing to this illness. You need to start planning to quit alcohol and tobacco as early as possible. Otherwise, this will progress and worsen. Your alcohol consumption has already reached the level where you start developing withdrawal symptoms in the form of difficulty to sleep and abdominal disturbances in its absence. So, you should start the composite therapy for both alcohol and tobacco dependence as well as for major depressive illness without any further delay."}

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

During her last blood and urine test, there were some issues with lipid profile test apart from sugar fasting and PP. When doctor performed ECG, there was some problem with that also.

A regular cycle signifies a normal ovulation and thus a fertile status. I presume you are suffering from anovulation, which means absence of ovulation. There are 100 causes of anovulation whereas the most common cause of anovulation is polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS, a complex endocrine disorder of uncertain etiology, where ovaries turn into cystic structures. Other causes are obesity, thyroid disorders, underweight, anorexia nervosa, stress, overt exercise, and usage of some medications. You have a body weight only 40 kg with BMI 17.28 . This is a bit lower than normal weight.You were on antidepressant, which you have left, also which could cause anovulation. Are you suffering from any psychiatric illness still now? These all could cause anovulation and amenorrhoea. You have taken also Depo shot one year back. I do not know why you had taken, but this medicine itself can cause absence of cycle. Whatever may be the reason, you need a detailed evaluation. You need to increase your body weight, need hormonal screening LH, FSH, thyroid, prolactin, testosterone and an USG screening for polycystic ovaries. Just get a regular cycle and then try to conceive when you will achieve this. Anovulation. 1. Serum level of LH, FSH, prolactin, thyroid, testosterone. 2. USG lower abdomen."}

When I got up to use the restroom, I noticed tingling in my lower leg and developed drop foot as a result. My first visit was to a podiatrist and he suggested me to visit a neurologist. The neurologist did not run any scientific test and determined I likely crushed my peroneal nerve and said to return in four to six weeks for physical therapy. About two weeks later, while lying in bed on my side, I noticed my arm tingle a bit and when I got up to shake it out the tingling eventually subsided. But, I have experienced weakness in that arm. Last night while sitting upright on my bed, my left leg began to experience a similar sensation. The limbs are still functional and the tingling does not persist, but it feels weak. The uncertainty due to the lack of scientific testing is weighing very heavily on me and the troubling issue is the onset of additional symptoms which are causing occasional unsettling stomach feelings due to the mental anguish I have been experiencing. Mainly the fact that all of my limbs feel weak are making me very concerned.", "output": "Hi. I have read your complaints and first of all I should compliment you for having patiently written a thorough history of events.

The next important point which you have told is the mode of onset and the tingling eventually subsided. The following parameters can be found out only by a clinical examination and they are most important to fix the diagnosis. In the same way, need to get at least two investigations, nerve conduction studies and MRI spine. It can be either a peripheral vascular disease leading to low perfusion or a peripheral neuropathy. I would strongly recommend as well as request you to consult your neurologist immediately and treat these symptoms as top priority. 1. Nerve conduction studies. 2. MRI spine. The symptoms suggest either it could be peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease."}

Low Oestrogen pill means Progesterone dominant pill. In fact progesterone does cause gastritis leading to nausea and vomitting. Moreover it causes sluggishness of the intestinal motility leading to constipation rather than loose motions. So this episode of loose motions is most likely by gastrointestinal disturbance due to some other cause. Whatever is the reason, please support yourself with oral rehydration solution. After each motion, take a glassful of warm water with 2 tsf of sugar and a pinch of salt in it. Otherwise many oral rehydration powders like Electral are available with the chemists you may opt for one of them. If within 24 hours, the loose motions are not in control, you will have to report to your physician. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"}

The other possible cause can be a fractured or broken filling or decay in between two teeth. Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. You need to take a radiograph to rule out any bone loss and tooth infection. If there is a gum infection, you need to get the teeth cleanedscaling and root planing with graft placement.If there is tooth infection, it has to be treated with RCT and crown.I hope my answer will help you, take care."}

GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain belching, burping etc. So we need to treat your GERD first. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Go for walking after meals. 6. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. Dont worry, you will be alright with all these.

{"context": "Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?", "input": "Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?", "output": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the preseminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best."}

My doctor believes it to be allergy-related, as I did a chest X-ray and that came back clear, so he has prescribed me two inhalers. One is Salbutamol and the other is a corticosteroid. They both have seemed to have helped but unfortunately, I believe they are the cause of my severe acne, as the acne soon developed after beginning the inhalers. I was wondering if there is an alternative to these prescribed inhalers.", "output": "Did your doctor prescribe you to undergo a PFT or pulmonary function test accompanied with a reversibility with bronchodilator? If not, then before using inhalers, the diagnosis of bronchial asthma must be established. I suggest you stop the steroid inhaler for three months if your symptoms are not present at present and then you go to a pulmonologist and get your PFT done. For the time being, if the frequency of symptoms is less than one per month, you can take the Salbutamol inhaler on a required basis. For allergy, you can take the combination Monteleukast 10 with Levocetirizine 5 at bedtime for 15 days. Steroid inhalers although have few systemic adverse effects, should not be prescribed in the absence of an established diagnosis of bronchial asthma. If the diagnosis cannot be established even after thorough investigations and if symptoms are distressing, then one can advise a trial of a steroid inhaler. There is also a variant of asthma which is called cough predominant asthma which your doctor had thought you have, I guess. Lastly, gastroesophageal reflux is a very common cause of a chronic cough with a normal Xray chest. so you can take a combination of Pantoprazole 40 with Domperidone 30 sustainedrelease before food for one month."}

{"context": "My lower tooth started moving after wisdom teeth removal. What should I do?", "input": "Hi doctor, Around six months ago, I removed four wisdom teeth (one tooth per month). I remember the first two were not very painful, but the third and the fourth ones, especially the fourth, gave me really bad headaches and it even made my whole cheek swell for a few days. Anyways, I also noticed this one tooth from my lower teeth started moving after all of my wisdom teeth were removed, and so I started putting on my retainers at night, but the problem is that in the morning when I eat, that tooth starts moving again and I get a headache eventually during the day. My orthodontist told me that there is nothing wrong with my retainers and that this headache could be caused by me grinding my teeth at night. I have also been told to do a CBCT scan. Any suggestions on what I should do? Should I go back to wearing braces on my lower teeth?", "output": "Braces are not good for the time being. Allow the molar tooth to become firm. Get an Xray done to confirm whether there is any periodontal recession. The bone support may be very less at the area behind where the wisdom tooth was removed, hence more mobility to front tooth. You may need periodontal surgery along with root canal treatment to make it firm."}

{"context": "What causes high CRP,leucocyte count and neutrophils in a child?", "input": "Hi, my baby was being delivered with the umbilical cord tight around his neck, The Dr cut the cord & baby came out a few seconds later. My baby was pale & not breathing & it took them about 4 minutes to resuscitate him. Baby s eyes were opened & he was crying. He was then put in the incubator & taken to the nursery where he has been kept for 2 days. I have been told that he might have some brain damage due to him not breathing & not having oxygen to the brain. Also he did not get the transfusion of blood from the placenta due to the cord being cut. Could this pose a problem in his brain development? & if so is there anything we can do now that he is only 2 days old to avoid future problems (such as giving him iron supplement to create red blood cells for oxygen in his blood)? I have seen him & he seems fine & is very responsive & has good reflexes. He does however have blood clots in the white of his eye, around the pupil & at the corner of his eye. Is this due to the umbilical cord strangling him or something else & will the blood clots clear up?", "output": "The blood clots you notice in the eyes will surely clear off completely, do not worry about it. Your baby now being well active, feeding well and good reflexes suggest that the brain is well functioning and preserved well. I would at this point suggest, not to worry about past and enjoy your baby, leave the rest to your pediatrician who will assess him on every visit. Hope this clarifies your doubts.

{"context": "Is a person with previous pneumonia attack more prone to Covid-19?", "input": "Hi doctor,  I have a general question that relates personally to myself in relation to Covid-19. I am a woman of 45 years and several years ago I had a severe case of pneumonia and I was hospitalized for a few weeks (which I have completely no memory of). It took me further 12 weeks to start to feel normal again. Since then I have had at least two chest infections a year and have also in the past two years I had many UTI's and kidney infections one of which was a few weeks ago and took lots of antibiotics to help. At the moment, I have a slight sore throat and like many do not know what and how to react to this. I have never been diagnosed with any conditions but as I said get chest infections, UTIs, and kidney infections often. Am I more at risk of catching COVID-19 and would I be put into the category of someone who has for example, COPD etc.? I am very worried and scared as I know how ill I was when I got pneumonia and also my husband has diabetes and high blood pressure, which makes me even more concerned? I am currently on Naproxen, Co-codamol (when required due to back and neck pain resulting from a car accident) Fluoxetine (daily).", "output": "We all are at risk to COVID19, but regular washing, sanitization of hands and use of masks outside the home can reduce the risk. Since you have encountered pneumonia earlier, your defense system must be boosted up. Still, I would recommend that you talk to your physician and get yourself vaccinated with 1. Influenza Quadrivalent vaccine yearly. 2. Pneumococcal vaccine every sixth year. These vaccines provide good prophylaxis against typical bacterial and viral infections."}

But I m going from cool weather to pretty warm weather", "output": "Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you can fly. No need to worry much. Bronchitis needs bronchodilator treatment along with antibiotics. So better to consult pulmonologist and start inhaled bronchodilators.Inhaled treatment in the form of meter dose inhaler containing LABA long acting beta 2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are mainstay of treatment. So better to start this so that your bronchitis can get controlled before air travel. And you can also use inhaled treatment in plane.So better to consult pulmonologist and start inhaled treatment."}

{"context": "", "input": "my baby is nearly 7 months old. he has colic when he was 2 weeks old, and has always had trouble with feeding. It used to take me 2 hours to feed him a bottle. he is gassy and windy. The DR has told me he has a slow digestion and it will resolve by it self. I havent started giving him soilds. When will his system be normal and when should i give him soilds?", "output": "hi... this is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. you will be more convinced. usually i dont advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. the two best ways to relieve this distress is 1. do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. if still crying  put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. hope my answer was helpful for you. i am happy to help any time. if you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. wish your kid good health."}

My local doctor wants this thing out, so do I but she wants to wait and watch it.  I am very nervous that this will turn bad.  She says there is no chance of that happening.  I have a family history of cancer.  My mother, grandmother and everyone on my mother's side have died from cancer, 2 of them from pancreatic cancer.  She cannot understand why I am worried about this and thinks I just want some surgery.  My question is, do I have a reason to worry, do I push to have this growth taken out now.  She did say that she would do it if I insisted.  If she agrees to do it, can I trust her?Hope you can help me decide if I should push this and if yes, how do I go about it.", "output": "cysts and cancer are usually easily diagnosed by imaging techniques. Also some tumor markers can help to evaluiate this. If this was cancer it would already show aggresivity in these 6 weeks since pancreatic tumors are infiltrative. all you need is frequent follow up to se cyst size progression.Wish you good health.

I have common allergies (mold, dust, ragweed, animal dander) that I receive shots for every week. I live in the southeastern United States where the pollen count is high right now. No health issues, including current illness or diseases. I quit smoking 3 months ago after smoking for 17 years. I have been a runner for the past 4 years, but now when I run I have a difficult time breathing. Even 24 hours after running, it is difficult to breathe. What is going on with my lungs? Why was it easier to breathe when I was a smoker?", "output": "Smoking is also an irritant and decreases the capacity of the lung over time. If you quit smoking, it is always helpful. It not only prevents further damage to your lungs and heart but slowly they recover as well but the absolute amount of recovery depends on the amount of initial damage. In your case, in my opinion, you shouldnt link your cessation of smoking with breathlessness its always the opposite. Focusing back on your allergy, If I was your physician, I would like to get you examine the status of your lungs as well as test your allergies to make sure you havent developed a new one or that the other ones are in check. It would also be advisable to start an antiallergic like Desloratidine 10 mg daily and Montelukast sodium 10mg daily in this season, until pollen counts are below safe levels.I hope its helpful."}

With steroid injection only the symptomatic treatment can be done and nothing more to reverse the degeneration process.I will advice you to do regular general body exercises, take oxygen therapy, do breathing exercises, meditation and allow the body to utilize its own natural medicine produced within to help control the degeneration process.In my clinical practice, i have seen cases with macular degeneration and performing the combination of therapy i mentioned, it has got some benefits in the patients, but to be honest the reversal process will surely take time.

Usually life expectancy is less than five years.But without chemotherapy, it will be less then 2 years.So better to start chemotherapy as soon as possible in her case."}
{"context": "", "input": "Hey, I m AAAAA, and 21years old. I have received my MRI scan after many months of back discomfort and the report says its all normal except at the last observation which says: Lumbar spondylosis with small posterior central bulge L5/S1 disc mildly indenting the Thecal sac and nerve roots. It gets very uncomfortable when I sit in the same position for over 10 minutes or so, Sometimes when I sit on hard surfaces I tend to feel some numbness in my legs or pins and needles which takes a few minutes to go away after I stretch ... Also last time I was doing my training ( boxing ) I noticed that when I was doing jumping exercises after a few minutes I started not being able to lift my legs in the jump with much agility, almost like I didn t have total control of them and my balance was clearly disminished on the landing of each jump.. What could this be and what can I do? Thank you for your attention", "output": "hi, it sounds like your symptoms are out of proportion to the mri findings. the mri indicates that there is mild indenting of the thecal sac and nerve roots. this is subjective, but does not sound very significant. bottom line, your ordering physician must correlate these findings with your symptoms. some docs consider a nerve conduction study or spinal injections for localization of symptoms. my concern is that you should also look elsewhere given the striking symptoms versus the mild disease on mri. good luck,"}

A few doctors have told me I have sustained clonus in the left leg. However, all scans and tests show normal. Symptoms include: severe weakness, spasticity, rolling, hyperreflex, etc", "output": "Clonus  its a higher motor function controlling and just by the ligament of the ankle this can not happen. Spasticity  this is also a higher motor function controlling and not the ligament connection. Hyper reflex  I think you meant by this is that the plantar reflex is having hyper tone. So this is also the Higher motor function and nothing to do with the ligament. Did you mention about scans in history? Were you talking about the MRI? Have you taken the MRI of ankle or the brain? If of brain than what did it reveal in the higher centres of brain? and if ankle than what did it reveal about the internal structures of the ankle? you even mentioned about the test? what tests have been done? blood? urine? I dont think surgery of ligament makes any sense over here with respect to the symptoms you mentioned. The symptoms you mentioned are of higher motor functions in the higher centres of the brain. I will recommend you to meet up a neurologist rather an orthopedist. A neurologist will be the right person to guide you. Coming back to clonus, spasticity and weakness.

Due to the COVID issue, we are reluctant to go to another doctor with our query, and our current doctor is in our blood relation, so we are feeling shy to ask her the question of having sex.", "output": "Congrats on your pregnancy. Though you have not mentioned clearly how many weeks of pregnancy, I assume it must be within the first 12 weeks as you have said she is recently pregnant. The symptoms of tiredness, nausea, lethargy, unable to eat are very common first trimester symptoms. The key is to eat frequent small foods which are good in protein. Lots of fluid intakes also are advised. Have you done a firsttrimester scan? If not, you are advised to do the scan to rule out any cause for the menstrual cramps and also the position of the developing placenta. If she has a menstrual cramplike symptom, I would advise to not to strain herself too much. Sexual activity is better avoided in the first 12 weeks as it can lead to abortions. After 12 weeks, if your scan is normal and the placenta is not low lying, unprotected intercourse can be done. Avoiding penetration would be another way to keep it safe in the second trimester, provided all other factors are normal. I hope this helps."}

Do you think my next step will be an MRI to determine what the pain is coming from?", "output": "hi,thankyou for providing the brief history.As the history suggest that this is more of a lumbar spine disc degenerative disease. As due to nerve root impingement in the lumbar spine the sciatic notch in the gluteal region will have a severe pain and needs a thorough clinical examination and an MRI to understand the pathology of the lumbar spine.Infact with 11 session of physical therapy the pain can not come down and may need more sessions as well. Taking therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help control the pain symptomatically and exercises will play an important role in stabilizing the spine and also improving the muscle strength to hold the spine without leading to nerve root impingement.In my clinical practice most patients need more than 15 session of physical therapy and they respond well.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"}

So your fiance is the source of the infection. So he too should have the same course of antibiotics. Treatment is never complete without both partners being treated. So he will not get inflammation, he will infect you again and your old symptoms will reappear.

But her SGPT is normal, the doctor prescribed GODEX capaule once a day for 1 month,, is it possible to cure my daughter and not be able to have induced drug hepatitis? Shes 8 yrs old,", "output": "I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I am puzzled as to why your daughter is being given Godex capsules if she has tuberculosis. Godex is to treat a fatty liver, muscle cramps, and a fish tapeworm intestinal infection, among other conditions. But not for tuberculosis. Side effects of Godex includefeeling of pins and needles in the body sleepinessdiarrheaface swellingheart failure Her SGOT level is very close to normal range and is not anything to be concerned about. It may even be due to a lab error. An SGOT reading in the hundreds would be something to be concerned about. Yes, it is possible to cure your daughter and not have druginduced hepatitis. This side effect does not happen often. If your child is not taking pyridoxine as part of her antiTB therapy, you may want to ask if she should be taking it. Tuberculosis is a very serious disease. You MUST give her the medicines exactly as her doctor tells you to. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."}

Please get it very clear, your eustachian tube tube connecting the backside of the nose and middle ear is blocked and some maneuver Valsalva maneuver under supervision will surely help. What you can try at home is take steam inhalation, chew food, or chewing gum in an exaggerated way as it may open the tube. Stretch your ear a bit and you can try putting your little finger inside your ear and move it 10 15 times. Tinnitus may go away once the tube gets back to its normal position. Avoid caffeinated drinks tea, coffee, alcohol. If you have it even after that follow up with me."}
