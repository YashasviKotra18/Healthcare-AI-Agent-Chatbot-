Is there anything that will stop this coughing. My bronchial tubes are very sore.","COPD causes airway inflammation and increased sputum production, worsened by infection.

I recently went to the ER for severe coughing due to mountain cedar which triggered my asthma. I was given a breathing treatment and Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg cap. Every since I started taking the antibiotic I have had severe headaches with a lot of pressure. I have had only about 5 hrs of sleep in 4 days due to the pressure and headache worsening when I lay down. Any suggestions why I'm getting like this?,"Headache is a known side effect of doxycycline, often resolving after discontinuation. Reduce salt intake to lessen pressure. If symptoms persist, consult your doctor to adjust the antibiotic.","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to an underlying sinusitis. For that reason, I would recommend performing some tests : -a nasal endoscopy-complete blood count (CBC)-blood electrolytes-fasting glucose-uric acid levels. An abdominal ultrasound should also be performed. A chest Xray study might help exclude pulmonary causes. If these tests result normal, you may need to take anti histamines such as loratadine or cetirizine. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,"
"Hi doctor, I have candida balanoposthitis. I consulted a doctor, and he gave me Glospor DS 200 mg for a week with Livafin ointment. But still, I am having red spots on the penis. My penis is uncircumcised. Please provide your suggestion.","Persistent red spots may indicate incomplete resolution of candida infection. Continue antifungal treatment (e.g., fluconazole orally and topical clotrimazole) for 2-4 weeks. Maintain hygiene by retracting the foreskin and cleaning daily. If no improvement, test for diabetes or reassess for other infections.",HelloThanks for writing to Chat Doctor.

The treatment involves antifungal medicines such as Fluconazole tablets(150mg) once daily along with topical antifungal cream containing clotrimazole. Ensure proper personal hygiene by using condom during sex. Avoid sexual encounters till complete recovery. Get well soonRegards Chat Doctor.

Immediate ER evaluation is critical to prevent amputation. Imaging (e.g., X-ray or MRI) and antibiotics are urgent.","Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to arthritis of the ankle. I suggest doing blood tests (complete blood count) and X-ray study of the affected area.

I have a acorn sized lump beside my left testicle. A few days ago I squeezed it and got white stuff out of it. It has gotten so painful that I cant sit down. I tried squeezing it again but nothing comes out. Its really too painful to squeeze anymore. It is red and hot to the touch.,This is likely an infected sebaceous cyst. Avoid manipulating it further to prevent worsening infection. A broad-spectrum antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medication are needed. Consult a surgeon for possible excision once infection subsides.,"Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign cystic lesion like sebaceous cyst or Desmond cyst. Or you may have enlarged inguinal lymph node due to reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis or other infection. Enlarge inguinal lymph nodes cause swelling near groin area. Pain with swollen inguinal lymph node suggest reactive hyperplasia or tuberculosis. You should go for examination first. Then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health."
"Hi. Im just wondering because i forgot to take my birth control pill 2 times in 8 days, iv been jumping over my period like 4 times, so i get a little bleeding(is this dangerous?), and i had sex yesterday, do you think the risk for pregnancy is there?? if it is, is it too late to take the morning after pill??","Missing pills increases pregnancy risk, especially with recent unprotected sex. Breakthrough bleeding is common but not dangerous. Take an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse. Resume regular pills and use backup contraception for 7 days.","Hello, Thanks for writing here. I have gone through your question. Your concern is regarding missed pills of contraception. It can lead to failure of contraceptive method. If you did not ovulate then no need to worry as conception will be prevented. But if you took tablet regularly then you should go for emergency pill within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. This has high success rate but still it needs to be taken properly according to instructions. Hope I answered your question. Would be happy to help you further. Take care."

I plan on drinking a whole week (seven days) after I take my last pill. Will I be fine?","Terbinafine’s half-life is 36 hours, with traces lingering for weeks. After 7 days, alcohol is safe in moderation. Limit intake for 3-4 weeks to allow liver recovery from potential minor stress.","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor !

Elevated estradiol (E2) could explain low libido; consider an aromatase inhibitor. Assisted reproductive techniques (e.g., IUI or IVF) are viable options. Add clomiphene, CoQ10, and lycopene to support sperm health.","Hi, Varicoceles can be treated by either open surgical repair or laparoscopically (keyhole). Laparoscopy has become the procedure of choice as it minimizes postoperative pain and shortens recovery time. The success rate following keyhole surgery is very high. Hope this helpsRegards Chat Doctor."
"I've had a root canal treatment on a tooth for the second time-the first root canal was three years ago-I was suffering with tenderness above the tooth for over a year, had my dentist check it and he couldn't see anything on x ray-about six weeks ago I had an infection in the tooth and had to have the root canal re-done-after my dentist had drained the infection, the pain subsided after a day or so and completely went after a few days. I went back to my dentist for the second part of the root canal, he cleaned everything out and put a temporary filling into the tooth and made an appointment for four weeks later. I returned to my dentist to have the root canal completed-this was done without any problems, although a week or so later, i'm getting tenderness again at the root of the tooth, and I can feel it if I press with my finger. The tooth isn't right, and i'm not comfortable with the tenderness. The tooth is already crowned. What can be done?","Persistent tenderness suggests residual infection or root fracture. If no pain on biting, a course of antibiotics (e.g., Augmentin) and anti-inflammatories (e.g., Ibuprofen) may resolve it. If unresolved, extraction may be needed due to poor prognosis.","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to inflammation around teeth. For this reason, I would recommend using anti-inflammatory medicines such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Diclofenac sodium (Cataflam). If these symptoms persist, you should consider performing a new X-ray study of that area. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,"
"Hi, I have what feels like a lump in my hip flexor, pretty much in the crease between lower abdominals and top of the quad. One on the right hip is slightly larger than the one on the left hip, and are not in symmetrical positions. When I press on either one they move around slightly, and no real pain just minor discomfort. It almost feels like a knot in a muscle. What could these be?","These are likely enlarged lymph nodes or lipomas. Lymph nodes may indicate infection or inflammation; lipomas are benign fat deposits. Imaging (e.g., ultrasound or CT) can confirm. Consult a surgeon if they grow or become painful.","Hi, Dear thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual clinic. After in depth study of your query, i understand your concerns.@Your symptoms suggest that you might be suffering from -Hernia / Lipoma/Lymph node enlargement@I would advise you to Consult ER Surgeon who would do physical examination along with ultrasound imaging studies which would help him diagnose it properly.@Meanwhile, please take anti-inflammatory medicine Diclofenac twice daily after meals with antibiotic Amoxyclav 625 once at night before sleeping till you get proper appointment and treatment by doctor.@These medicines would reduce swelling and inflammation as well as fight against infection if present.@Please don't worry, you will be alright soon.

"My MRI shows a left mid pole lateral cortical renal cyst (12 mm) and it also mentions left upper pole simple renal cortical cyst (10 mm). Are these the same cyst looking from different angles on the MRI, or are they two different ones. Also, what would the treatment be, if any?","These are likely two distinct simple renal cysts, common and benign in many adults. No treatment is needed unless they cause symptoms (e.g., pain or obstruction). Monitor with periodic ultrasound.","Hello! Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor! I carefully read your question and understand your concern. Cysts of kidneys can occur in various sizes and numbers. They do not cause symptoms unless grow very large or rupture. If there is no clinical evidence that this lesions produce pain or bleeding then we should consider them benign. The best way to treat such cases is observation with ultrasound imaging every six months. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes,"
"I had a c-section with my first pregnancy 19 years ago. I am concerned if I am able to have a VBAC delivery with my second pregnancy since my first pregnancy resulted in an emergency C-section. Also, I am 48. What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?","VBAC is possible but depends on prior C-section reason, uterine scar integrity, and current pregnancy factors. Risks over 40 include chromosomal abnormalities, hypertension, diabetes, and miscarriage. Preconception counseling and ultrasound are recommended.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor .I understand your concern. The decision regarding mode of delivery after previous cesarean section depends upon various factors such as type of incision made during previous surgery, reason for it, interval period between two deliveries, current obstetric history including age, weight, BMI, parity, gestational status, fetal presentation, growth parameters, maternal serum screening tests(AFP), ultrasound findings, etc. Please discuss these issues with your treating gynecologist/obstetrician who would be better judge of them.

"My name is roxann I am 29 trying to get pregnant I have a 12 year old daughter, I caught chlamydia 5 years ago and my tubes are blocked, I just did a laparoscopy surgery 3 weeks ago my right tube is completely damaged and my left tube is blocked they managed to clear the left tube but I still want to know my chances of getting pregnant and how long it going to take?","With one patent tube, conception chance is about 1-2% per cycle. It may take 6-12 months. Monitor ovulation and consider fertility treatments (e.g., IVF) if unsuccessful after 6 months.","Hi Roxy, Thanks for writing in Chat Doctor. If you wish to conceive naturally then there are good chances that you will become pregnant provided both ovaries respond normally. The problem with infertility cases is that we do not see them as patients till late. By this time many tests would have been done which may be normal if one were to look at each test separately. But since every organ system has interdependence, so even though some parameters might appear fine individually; collectively these can cause problems. So please visit an expert who can evaluate you properly and also guide you regarding treatment options. Hope this helps Good luckRegards"
Hi. I’ve been having really bad dizziness and headaches for the past few days. It also hurts to pee and breathe most of the time. Also a lot of the time I feel like I’m being stabbed down into my chest all the way to my lungs. I have these really bad cramps on my right side of my body where it will randomly make me fall on to my knees.,"Symptoms suggest a possible viral or bacterial infection (e.g., pneumonia or UTI). Chest pain and breathing difficulty need urgent evaluation. Basic tests (e.g., CBC, chest X-ray, urine analysis) can confirm diagnosis.

I’ve been taking Symbicort for 3 weeks (2 puffs twice a day) for asthma and feeling good. I recently lowered the dose to 1 puff a day (twice a day) and now feel wheezing/shortness of breath with just doing regular daily tasks. Is this a withdrawal symptom or being symptomatic for asthma? I have needed to take my Xopenex inhaler once a day.,Wheezing and shortness of breath indicate uncontrolled asthma due to reduced Symbicort dose. Resume 2 puffs twice daily with a spacer. Use Xopenex as needed. Add montelukast if nasal symptoms persist. Monitor with PFT every 6 months.,"Hello! Welcome at Chat Doctor !

"Trying to get my son (1 month) to take his formula. Nutramigen A+ (Hypoallergenic). He can’t stand it, and won’t eat it. He was a premie and required surgery to remove part of his bowel (small intestine, 13cm). We need him to eat this as he isn’t gaining weight, but he won’t. What do we do?",Avoid adding flavors due to fragile intestines. Consult a pediatrician about alternatives like Alimentum or temporary nasogastric feeding to ensure nutrition and weight gain.,Hi...by what you quote I feel that the kid might be having viral diarrhea which usually takes around five days to resolve.

"My wife recently got pregnant. She is facing tiredness or fatigue, continuous nausea-type feeling, lethargy, unable to eat properly or loss of appetite, minor menstrual cramps, constipation. We want to know if we can have normal sex with the mentioned condition of my wife. If we can have sex, does it need to be protected, or can we have unprotected sex, or will it affect the baby?","Symptoms are typical of early pregnancy (first trimester). Avoid intercourse until after 12 weeks due to miscarriage risk, especially with cramps. After 12 weeks, unprotected sex is safe if a scan confirms no low-lying placenta.","Hi, I think you should not worry much as these symptoms are common in first trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms may also occur due to hormonal changes during this period. As far as having intercourse is concerned there is no harm done by doing so but make sure that she has proper lubrication before penetration. Also, do not overexert yourself because excessive straining might cause bleeding which could lead to miscarriage. Hope I answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

"Yesterday I went to the ER with dizziness, tightness in my chest, tenderness in my chest cavity, pain shooting from the sternum straight through to my back and shortness of breath. My BP was 144/110 and pulse was over 92. I had an EKG that showed no abnormality. My blood work showed an elevation in the white cells and a chest x-ray was normal. The doctor decided to order a CT scan of my chest using dye. The results were normal. Every test keeps coming back normal. Is there another way to diagnose me?","Chest tightness and pain with elevated white cells suggest musculoskeletal pain or anxiety, not cardiac issues (normal EKG/CT). Consider nerve conduction studies or spinal evaluation for radiating pain. Psychiatric consultation may help if stress-related.","Hello! Welcome at Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to anxiety. Anyway, considering your past medical history, I would recommend performing some other tests:- complete metabolic panel,- thyroid hormone levels,- cortisol plasma level.- vitamin D3 plasma level.

"I am now having severe right buttocks pain, which has gotten worse after two cortisone shots, physical therapy for 11 sessions and an x-ray was taken in the beginning. Do you think my next step will be an MRI to determine what the pain is coming from?","Persistent pain despite treatment suggests lumbar disc disease or sciatica.
